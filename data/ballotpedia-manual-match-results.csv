				<p class=""survey-question"">Who are you? Tell us about yourself in 300 words or less.</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I am a Nurse Practitioner who works at one of Ohio's largest integrative community &amp; mental health service providers, serving some of the most vulnerable populations in our community. I am very proud of the work that I do everyday because I am doing what I was meant to do - fighting for those who need someone to fight for them. My love for being a patient advocate is what keeps me smiling all day at work.

But I feel that those who need an advocate like me has grown, and I have the will, the education, and the courage to be an advocate in a much bigger way. This is why I am running for Congress. 

I know we can DO BETTER WITH HEALTH CARE, JOBS, and HOUSING through compassion, courage, and true democracy in Ohio's 12th District. Others will tell you what you want to hear, I will tell you what you need to hear. </p>

				<ul class=""key-messages"">
					<li>I am a Nurse Practitioner that believes that we can do better with health care, jobs, and housing through compassion, courage, and true democracy in Ohio's 12th District.</li>
					<li>I became a nurse in order to advocate for patients and others in need. The best way for me to help today, is to fix the health care system.</li>
					<li>I will not be beholden to a political party, corporation, lobby, or PAC because I only accept donations from individuals. I am a worker, not a politician, not a business owner. Ohioans need a real representative of the people in Washington.</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
							<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What areas of public policy are you personally passionate about?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">The dysfunctional healthcare system in America affects more Ohioans than any other issue. Nothing else even comes close. The current system of private insurance, large for-profit healthcare systems, and massive drug companies is dangerous, unethical, and cruel. These industries have been working together for decades to inflate costs, evolving into a monster whose sole purpose is to take in as much profit as possible. This has left Ohio families just inches from crippling financial hardships and in many cases, quite literally, death.

We live in the greatest country in the world. There is no excuse for a person to have to choose between feeding their children and paying for inflated medical bills.

No Ohioan should worry about the cost of a co-pay, an insurance premium, or the price of a medication. No Ohioan should delay care due to cost. Current leaders tell us that universal healthcare is not financially possible. They try to frighten us by saying we cannot have excellent healthcare and provide care for all. This is SIMPLY NOT TRUE. 

I will protect affordable housing for Ohio's families. I will fight for Ohioans' right to a living wage. I will work to bring new, forward-thinking industry to Ohio. We will create jobs by targeting workforce development, prioritizing  industry that looks towards the future (like green energy), and encouraging organized labor to champion competitive wages and benefits. I will lead the charge for campaign finance reform.</p>

I remember the presidential race in 1988 - specifically Jesse Jackson speaking at the Democratic National Convention. I also remember the Berlin wall coming down in 1989, and the Russians staging a coup in the early 1990s.</p>

It’s time to make South Jersey great again by making South Jersey a manufacturing powerhouse. We can bring modern manufacturing and other high-wage jobs to South Jersey by investing in new construction, defense-related industries, and medical-research projects. </li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Protect American Jobs and Revive the American Dream</b>: Washington politicians are in cahoots with Wall Street. Too many politicians support unbalanced trade deals that hurt middle-income workers and ship good-paying American jobs overseas. They also embrace immigration policies that have flooded the U.S. labor market with foreigners, robbing American workers.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Secure America’s Borders</b>: It’s also time to make sure jobs in America go to American workers, not refugees flooding our country through porous and insecure borders. Bob supports building a wall along America’s southern border, creating a foolproof entry-and-exit system, and establishing an airtight employment-verification system.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Put Main Street Ahead of Wall Street</b>: Washington politicians throw taxpayer money at Wall Street and well-connected lobbyists. It’s time to stop corporate welfare and start supporting America’s vital economic sectors that will help the working and middle classes.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Improve American Health through Cures</b>: Bob supports universal health-care coverage for all American citizens, but also believes we have to focus on lowering health-care costs. We can do that by investing resources in finding cures for cancer, Alzheimer's, and diabetes. We can achieve affordable care and actually improve lives by beating, rather than simply treating, these debilitating diseases. Bob had called for transforming the South Jersey-Philadelphia region into a medical-research enterprise zone that fast-tracks the discovery of cures and vaccines for these diseases.</li></ul>

				<p class=""survey-question"">Who are you? Tell us about yourself in 300 words or less.</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I have lived through a variety of economic circumstances including abundance and resorting to looking under the couch cushions for lost change. I have been without a home although I am grateful to have never slept without a roof over my head. I am able to empathize with someone who has little to nothing as well as someone who has worked very hard, succeeded, and feels they are having what they've earned picked apart for politicians to spend on things that don't agree with. I don't want to spend my life in politics. I would however like to get in, effect some change and ""vote myself out"" with term limits. I don't know everything but I can learn anything. I'm a critical thinker who does not believe that a strong stance on one position solidifies a stance on all others. I have a great deal of respect for personal freedoms and personal belief systems and support people to express both so long as that expression does not squash the rights of others. I am happy to engage in an exchange of ideas with people who hold different views than I and have on occasion changed my own views because I openly listened and saw something from a different perspective. I am not a polished politician. </p>

As a young man, I could not understand why after freeing Kuwait form Iraq's invasion so easily, he decided not to go into Baghdad when he had the world behind him and could have easily done it.  However, he had the self-confidence of a war hero who had nothing to prove and understood the Middle East well enough to know the disaster and  quagmire it would be.  Twenty-five years later history is now beginning to understand his great insight and wisdom in that decision.  He then went on to take unpopular stands to address acid rain and set the United States on a path to $300 billion surpluses.   I will always regret our country did not understand how fortunate we were to have him at the time.</p>

<ul><li><b>National Security</b>: Recent events in Europe and America have reminded us that terrorism continues to be a threat in our society. I’ve called for common-sense steps to protect Americans, like conducting reviews of our Visa procedures and ending the outrageous terrorist background check loophole that currently allows people on our nation’s Terror Watchlist to legally purchase deadly firearms and explosives.

				<p class=""survey-response"">I am a second generation native Floridian, born and raised in North Miami Beach. I currently live in Davie, with my husband and two boys. My academic background spans journalism, marketing, and law. From my earliest days of practicing law I have fought for those who can't fight for themselves by doing criminal defense, as well as helping young women receive a judicial bypass for an onerous process for their reproductive rights. I am currently a co-chair of the Juvenile Justice Committee for the Broward League of Women Voters, and work as an advocate in the community helping disenfranchised citizens regain their voting rights.</p>
			</div>
						    <div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Please list below 3 key messages of your campaign. What are the main points you want voters to remember about your goals for your time in office?</p>
				<ul class=""key-messages"">
					<li>Congressional representation is a TERM OF SERVICE and NOT A CAREER</li>
					<li>No corporate money. Period.</li>
					<li>Three key areas that should never be for profit: healthcare, public education, and corrections</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
							<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What areas of public policy are you personally passionate about?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">My top three campaign issues:
Medicare for All (single-payer)
Green New Deal (environmental AND economic JUSTICE)
Criminal justice reform (abolishing for-profit prisons and decriminalization of marijuana)</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Who do you look up to? Whose example would you like to follow, and why?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Thurgood Marshall. He is the ultimate example of courage, with the intelligence to back it up. He stood up for civil rights over and over again. And if he got knocked down, he would stand up and do it again.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Is there a book, essay, film, or something else you would recommend to someone who wants to understand your political philosophy?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">A People's History of the United States, by Howard Zinn. It should be required reading in high school. Until you have learned history from the perspective of the conquered, you haven't learned history.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What legacy would you like to leave?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I would love to leave office knowing that I made it easier for all people to be involved in the political process. I would love to get all private money OUT of the system, and create publicly-financed elections. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What is the first historical event that happened in your lifetime that you remember? How old were you at the time?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">The 1976 Bicentennial. I was 5. I also very specifically remember when Sandra Day O'Connor became the first woman on the Supreme Court. I was 10.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What was your very first job? How long did you have it?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">My first job was at Lombard's Sporting Goods in North Miami Beach. </p>

			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What qualities does the U.S. House of Representatives possess that makes it unique as an institution?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Representatives have the most opportunity to connect with constituents on a regular basis. They are the people that should most accurately reflect the values of their constituents. It is the ""People's House"".</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Do you believe that it's beneficial for representatives to have previous experience in government or politics?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">It depends on the experience. I think that life experience and the ability to connect with people is equally important. I do think that it is important to have an understanding of policy and how it relates to governance.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What do you perceive to be the United States’ greatest challenges as a nation over the next decade?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Climate crisis is the single biggest threat to human existence on the planet. In the United States, we also have a significant challenge to restore any semblance of representative democracy, wherein our government works for the collective, and not just an elite few.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">If you are not a current representative, are there certain committees that you would want to be a part of?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Climate Crisis, Judiciary, Ethics</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Do you believe that two years is the right term length for representatives?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">No. This is the reason that representatives end up spending half of their terms running for re-election. I believe that longer terms would allow for more time to focus on actual legislation.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What are your thoughts on term limits?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I support term limits. With 2-year terms, I support a limit of 4 terms, or 8 years. I believe that 2 terms, or 12 years, is sufficient for Senate.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Is there a particular representative, past or present, whom you want to model yourself after?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Bernie Sanders. I have been a fan of his since he was in the House. There is nobody in Congress with the same amount of consistent integrity and honor.</p>

We face real challenges at home and around the world. We want and need our elected leaders to work together to find solutions to our shared problems, but Washington is not working as it should. Partisanship has led to gridlock, politicians refuse to work across party lines, and we all pay the price. I launched this campaign because we need new leaders in Washington who will put people above politics and deliver results.
</p><p>Houstonians are hardworking, welcoming, innovative, and caring. We are problem solvers. We are big thinkers. We are collaborators. And we are facing real challenges. We need everyone—Democrats and Republicans—to participate as we address our community’s challenges. While we may not always agree on exactly how to overcome each challenge, we can all agree that our elected representatives should work together to find solutions—and to care more about the people they represent than their political parties.
</p><p>It is time for Texas’ 7th Congressional District to have a representative who knows who we are, understands our challenges, protects what we have worked for, ensures we stay healthy, and keeps us safe.
</p><p>These principles guide my vision for the district and the policy priorities we will address in our campaign.
</p>
<ul><li>Understanding our challenges means making our city more resilient by bolstering infrastructure to keep us safe from increasing and more frequent weather events, and partnering with our local agencies to make smart investments in mass transit. It means encouraging federal revitalization programs that provide high-risk communities like ours with the resources we need to be prepared for, and reduce the costs of, the next storm; passing a federal infrastructure investment plan that puts money into infrastructure improvements while creating local jobs; and working with METRO to expand our transit system to keep our workforce—and our economy—moving forward. </li>
<li>Knowing who we are means knowing how our diverse, hard-working community functions and ensuring that its values are protected. This means understanding our economy and finding ways to remain global leaders. It means working with our institutions and companies to create and increase access to work training programs for our workforce; increasing access to capital and credit for Texans who want to start or expand their own businesses, so businesses of all sizes and in all sectors thrive; and passing equitable tax reform that encourages domestic job growth rather than incentives that promote the outsourcing of jobs and investments that should be kept in Houston.</li>
<li>Protecting what we have worked for means protecting Social Security and Medicare. As the deficit and the national debt continue to rise, Congressional actions put the future of our investments at risk. We must keep the promise to retired Americans by opposing consistent efforts to efforts to turn Social Security and Medicare into voucher programs or use them to pay for irresponsible tax cuts; addressing waste in these and all government programs to ensure only those eligible get the benefits in which they invested; and preserving the integrity of the programs for those who pay into them now.</li>
<li>Ensuring we stay healthy means knowing that our residents are rightly concerned about access to and affordability of health care. Congress is not helping. We stay healthy by reversing the impact of reckless partisanship and working with both parties to bring down the cost of health care by introducing common-sense, cost-saving measures like allowing Medicare to negotiate with drug companies to lower prescription drug prices; to defend women’s access to reproductive health care; and to fight any attempt to eliminate protections for people with pre-existing conditions like cancer, diabetes, or asthma. </li>
<li>Keeping us safe means making smart policy and enforcing it by working with and across our diverse community. It means strengthening our border security by making smart investments in Border Patrol and new technologies; by reforming our immigration laws to protect Dreamers and those who follow the law and contribute to our economy; by reducing gun violence; by making sure law enforcement, including ICE, can do its job to keep our communities safe; and by ensuring our justice system is efficient and fair. It means having leaders who engage in thoughtful foreign policy and diplomacy abroad to help keep us safe at home.</li></ul>
<p><b>Civil Rights</b><br>
In 2017, we saw the vision of a minority who want to return America to the Jim Crow era, where mobs and terror reigned, where discrimination on the basis of race, religion, sex, sexual orientation, and national origin was both practice and policy, and where the basic humanity of our fellow citizens was denied. We must not let this happen.
</p><p>We must choose to reject hate, bigotry, and racism. We must work for equality, justice, and freedom for all Americans. We saw that, too, in 2017: clergy, students, and citizens standing up to racist mobs, rejecting their ideas, and denouncing hate. We must continue to do so.
</p><p>And we must elect leaders who do it with us; who speak out forcefully against the hateful vision of America we have seen on display in Charlottesville and elsewhere.
</p><p>There is no doubt that our history is complex; we are an imperfect people with an imperfect past. Examining our society, our history, our privileges, and our biases is not always an obvious or easy process. For some, the hate and bigotry on display in Charlottesville was a shock and a wake-up call. For others, it was a demonstration of something they have been saying for some time: racism, bigotry, and hatred remain powerful forces in American life.
</p><p>We are called now to protect our fundamental American ideals—equality, liberty, justice, freedom, civil rights, and democracy—and to ensure that these ideals define our society. In Congress, I will work to protect the civil rights of every American.
</p><p><b>Education</b><br>
Quality education is essential to our democracy. Good schools are the foundation for an informed community, better jobs, and a strong economy.
</p><p>All children—no matter where they live—deserve the opportunity to reach their full potential. We must invest in public education and work to ensure its success. Teachers need to be able to teach. We need programs designed to close the achievement gap. We need to end the school-to-prison pipeline. We need to make sure that all of our schools offer the Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) curriculum that helps build the skills our students will need for the jobs of the future and also a curriculum that encourages them to think, to create, and to find their own voices.
</p><p>For the college-bound population, we must address the rising costs of tuition. For those who have graduated, we must find relief from crushing student debt. For-profit colleges must be held accountable for the false promises they made. Community colleges should be expanded, and access to technical and vocational programs should be encouraged.
</p><p>Failures in our education system will affect every aspect of our community, from the strength of our economy to the strength of our democracy itself. Educating all of our citizens should always be our priority.
</p><p>During the last legislative session, John Culberson got an “F” on the National Education Association’s legislative report card, reflecting his poor record of support for public education and educators.
</p><p><b>Equality</b><br>
Our nation’s laws are designed to protect against discrimination on the basis of race, color, and national origin. The Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Fair Housing Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, and many laws regarding federal government employment provide remedies to protect vulnerable groups. These laws should be enforced and expanded to ensure that everyone is treated fairly.
</p><p>I support a federal Equality Act that would amend the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and related statutes to ensure that discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity is prohibited. Gay and transgender people – and their families – should have the same rights and protections as others in the workplace, in housing, in healthcare decisions, and in our communities. This will not be an easy fight. State legislatures (including Texas) continue to debate legislation designed to deny equal rights to gay and transgender people even after the Supreme Court ruled in Obergefell v. Hodges that same-sex marriage is a fundamental right guaranteed by the Constitution. These discriminatory state laws—like the proposed bathroom bill in Texas—hurt all of us, and the best way to address them is to enact federal legislation that brings our laws in line with our values.
</p><p>As a member of Congress, I will fight to end discrimination and to retain the rights that so many, including the LGBT community, have fought so hard to achieve.
</p><p><b>Flooding &amp; Houston's Future</b><br>
Much of Houston’s future will be determined by how we manage the threat of flooding, including our recovery from Hurricane Harvey.
</p><p>Our recovery will take years, and we need to start now and rebuild wisely. To succeed, we need to plan to strengthen existing systems while implementing new infrastructure projects and smart policies.
</p><p>This plan would include:
</p>
<ul><li>Improving existing structures, including the Addicks and Barker reservoirs;</li>
<li>Facilitating the immediate completion of Project Brays;</li>
<li>Identifying additional detention areas;</li>
<li>Revising the floodplain maps;</li>
<li>Devising and installing a system for coastal surge protection;</li>
<li>Incentivizing public-private partnerships; and</li>
<li>Ensuring future federal projects are completed on time and on budget.</li></ul>
<p>We have learned that the increased flooding we are experiencing was not just predictable—it was actually predicted.
</p><p>In 1996, engineers for the Harris County Flood Control District issued a dire warning that our reservoir system was insufficient. The Army Corps of Engineers authorized five flood control projects between 1986 and 1990. Today—more than 20 years later—only one of them has been completed. In 2009, the Army Corps gave Addicks and Barker reservoirs the worst possible safety ratings and expressly designated them at an “extremely high risk of catastrophic failure.”
</p><p>After Tropical Storm Allison’s rains flooded the city in 2001, we developed Project Brays to protect the Texas Medical Center and those living and working along Brays Bayou. Sixteen years later, that project is far from completion.
</p><p>John Culberson has failed to provide the leadership we need in Congress to protect us from flooding. In 2018, we must hold him accountable for those failings. We can, and we must, finish the projects that will keep our families safe. To do this, we need an advocate in Congress, not a bystander. We need a partner in Congress who will help us secure the resources, the information, and the assistance we need to do so—one who will work with the city, the county, and all agencies and partners to make sure we do it right.
</p><p>'<i>Gun Safety</i><br>
We don’t have to live this way; gun violence in America doesn’t have to be inevitable. We can fix this. But if we truly want to save lives and protect our children, we need leaders who aren’t afraid to take on the corporate gun lobby.
</p><p>In Congress, I will fight for common-sense gun safety measures, including:
</p>
<ul><li>Passing a ban on all military-style assault weapons;</li>
<li>Raising the age to buy all firearms to 21;</li>
<li>Requiring universal background checks on all gun sales;</li>
<li>Equipping law enforcement with the tools they need to keep guns out of the hands of individuals who are dangers to themselves and others;</li>
<li>Eliminating bump stocks, devices that convert semi-automatic weapons into fully automatic weapons;</li>
<li>Tightening regulations on high-capacity magazines; </li>
<li>Closing the “boyfriend loophole” and stopping domestic abusers from owning and buying guns;</li>
<li>Cracking down on illegal gun trafficking; and</li>
<li>Fully fund comprehensive research on gun violence and prevention.</li></ul>
<p><b>Health Care</b><br>
We are proud of Houston’s role in leading advances in medicine. From the first heart transplant to the cutting-edge research in the Texas Medical Center today, we have led the way for decades.
</p><p>But even though we are a leader in health care research, and cutting edge advances, many people in our community and across the country do not have access to quality healthcare. We have an obligation to make sure they do. This takes many forms, from maintaining and improving the Affordable Care Act (ACA) to defending reproductive healthcare and woman’s right to choose.
</p><p>The ACA was a strong first step toward making health care accessible, but we have work ahead of us to improve it.
</p><p>Strengthening the ACA begins with stabilizing the market. Our community relies on the healthcare industry – not just for our own care, but also for our jobs. We have the largest medical center in the world, and instability in the healthcare market means instability in Houston’s economy.
</p><p>Millions of Texans are enrolled under ACA. Millions more in the state lack health insurance entirely. To cripple effective and affordable health care for our citizens, the Trump Administration has held the cost-sharing reduction subsidies hostage, leading to premium increases and making healthcare less affordable. Prescription drug costs are skyrocketing. Patients are going without care. And insurance companies are raking in record profits.
</p><p>John Culberson has been the Trump Administration’s eager accomplice in trying to take health care away from the people who need it most. Culberson voted to repeal or defund the Affordable Care Act more than 20 times knowing it would cause residents in the district with pre-existing conditions and many others to lose their healthcare coverage.
</p><p>It is time to devote real and serious attention to addressing the pressing health care needs of Houstonians and all Americans, not recklessly dismantling the system with no alternative plan in place, as the Republican Congress has sought to do at every turn.
</p><p><b>Immigration</b><br>
Houston is a city of immigrants. It is at the core of our very identity, and an essential part of what makes it a great place to live.
</p><p>There is no doubt that we need to fix our immigration system. It will not be easy to do. But instead of meaningfully addressing it, Congress has played politics for decades, using scare tactics to win elections instead of doing what’s best for our country.
</p><p>We need comprehensive immigration reform with a pathway to citizenship. It should be thoughtful, practical, and fair. It should include strengthening our border security, cracking down on employers who break the law, and ensuring law enforcement, including immigration and customs enforcement, can do its job to keep our communities safe. It should not include building a wall between us and our state’s top trading partner.
</p><p>In 2013, the Senate passed bipartisan bill to address this pressing issue—by a 2-to-1 margin—after negotiation and compromise. The House of Representatives has refused to consider the bill. The failure of the House even to debate this bill or propose other meaningful solutions is a stark example of the gridlock and dysfunction that has failed us for years.
</p><p>Congress must work together to address immigration issues. We must keep the promises we made to Dreamers and pass the DREAM Act. And we must act immediately to stop the devastating separation of families at the border. It is time to send people to Washington who will do so.
</p><p><b>Jobs &amp; Economy</b><br>
Houston is a hard-working city and a leader in cutting-edge invention and innovation.
</p><p>We should embrace Houston’s role as the energy leader, while continuing to diversify our economy. This starts by leading the way in developing clean-energy technology. Many of the most talented and experienced energy professionals in the world work here. We need to take the best advantage of that fact. We cannot allow the next generation of energy jobs to be created elsewhere.
</p><p>We are home to scientific, medical, and technological innovation. Baylor, Rice, and M.D. Anderson Cancer Center are just a few examples of world-class research institutions here making a real impact on our world. We should be fostering growth to attract more hi-tech and biotech research jobs to the area. This means everything from promoting investment in Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) fields, to directing grants and subsidies toward the incredible work being done in the diverse industries throughout Harris County.
</p><p>We must invest in our schools and encourage vocational training and re-training that helps people connect their interests and skills with good jobs.
</p><p><b>National Security &amp; Foreign Policy</b><br>
We are facing serious threats both abroad and at home, and nothing is more important than keeping our country safe.
</p><p>The Trump administration has dismantled the U.S. State Department, alienated our allies, and abandoned the leadership role the United States has historically played. This destructive behavior is about more than how we look to others—it is about the safety of American citizens.
</p><p>Taunting volatile nations does nothing but place our national security in jeopardy. Targeting people based on race or religious affiliation violates our Constitution and distracts from real threats to our safety.
</p><p>Congress must act to fill the policy and diplomatic vacuum the administration has created. Qualified individuals, without regard to partisan interest or affiliation, must fill critical roles, and we must restore funding to under-resourced outposts at home and abroad.
</p><p>We must work to repair our reputation and secure our alliances. And we must maintain our focus on stopping terrorist and other threats around the globe, including providing law enforcement the resources and training needed to prevent terrorism.
</p><p>We must prioritize support for our men and women who serve us in our military. Our troops put their lives on the line every day, and they deserve a government that honors them and the sacrifices they make for us all. This includes taking all necessary steps to protect them abroad and making sure that they are supported at home. We must ensure their access to quality healthcare, educational opportunities, claim resolution, and housing.
</p><p><b>Social Security &amp; Medicare</b><br>
Social Security is a promise we made to seniors who have paid into these programs with every paycheck. Medicare is the promise of health care coverage for millions of seniors and people with disabilities.
</p><p>We have an absolute obligation to keep these promises and protect Social Security and Medicare. I will oppose efforts to privatize Social Security and Medicare, and I will oppose efforts to cut benefits for seniors or the disabled.
</p><p>To ensure the long-term viability of these programs we need to make government work more efficiently by cutting wasteful spending, fraud, and abuse, but not by cutting these programs.
</p><p>Instead of protecting Social Security and Medicare programs, Culberson has voted to allow Congress to privatize them.
</p><p><b>Transportation &amp; Infrastructure</b><br>
One of the many things that makes Houston great is its welcoming attitude. And it shows. Talented and productive people want to come here: The Houston area is one of the fastest-growing metropolitan areas in the country.
</p><p>But our infrastructure has not kept up with our growth. From 2000 to 2010, the greater Houston area grew by more than 1.2 million people, and it is still growing. But our roads and transit system have not grown at the same pace, which makes it harder to transport goods, commute to work, and attract new businesses. Improving transportation in Houston is one of my top priorities.
</p><p>We need to partner with cities, counties, and METRO to bring additional resources and improvements to our region. We need an advocate for policies that both maintain and expand our region’s mobility infrastructure. And we need to make sure that Houston receives its fair share of transportation funding to move our citizens across the region.
</p><p>John Culberson has failed to be a partner in this effort. Even worse, his record shows that he has actively worked against expanding transportation options in Houston. It’s time for a change.
</p><p><b>Voting Rights</b><br>
All citizens have the constitutional right to vote. We should be enacting and enforcing laws that make it easier, not harder, for citizens to vote.
</p><p>Instead, Republican-dominated state legislatures (including Texas) keep passing laws that restrict or suppress voting by traditional Democratic voters in hopes of stacking the deck for future elections. These laws are designed to appear as if they do not discriminate: requiring a photo I.D., denying access to translators, and making voter registration more difficult by closing DMV locations in certain districts. But they do discriminate, and our courts have struck down these laws as unconstitutional because they intentionally discriminate against voters on the basis of race or have the effect of doing so.
</p><p>Partisan and racial gerrymandering have the same discriminatory effect. In practice, gerrymandering violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and it burdens our First Amendment rights of association and speech. Even still, it dominates our political system, disenfranchising voters and silencing their voices.
</p><p>We must fight for a better system to determine our representation, eliminate partisan bias, and work for an equitable voting process. This means championing a full restoration of the Voting Rights Act, challenging discriminatory voter identification laws, legalizing same-day registration or implementing universal automatic registration, and expanding early voting and vote-by-mail options.
</p><p>In Congress, I will be committed to protecting voting rights, not restricting them.
</p><p><b>Women's Health</b><br>
The health and safety of half of the population has been under relentless attack. Women must take a seat at the table to speak out for our needs.
</p><p>Access to reproductive healthcare is essential to all Americans’ ability to control their lives. It is a matter of health. It is a matter of economics. It is a matter of justice. And it is not negotiable.
</p><p>Protecting women’s access to safe and affordable health care is one of my top priorities. I have been an advocate for this issue for more than 25 years. When I was in high school, I stood outside a Houston Planned Parenthood clinic in the August heat to stop protestors who threatened to chain themselves to the doors and prevent women from entering the clinic. After college, I co-founded Planned Parenthood Young Leaders to build a new generation of supporters for this important community partner.
</p><p>I will stand firmly against Donald Trump, John Culberson, and the Republicans in Congress who continue to attack Planned Parenthood. I will work to protect the Title X Family Planning Program and access to affordable reproductive health services. I will support policies to encourage access to contraception. And I will always stand up for the right to choose.<sup id=""cite_ref-quotedisclaimer_8-0"" class=""reference""><a href=""#cite_note-quotedisclaimer-8"">[8]</a></sup>

				<p class=""survey-question"">Who are you? Tell us about yourself in 300 words or less.</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Born in Minnesota, Dan Feehan grew up north of Rochester and was inspired into service after witnessing the terrorist attacks on the Pentagon on September 11, 2001 while he was a college student. 
                                
He committed himself to military service in the coming months, signing up for Army ROTC . From 2005 through 2009, he served as an active duty soldier and completed two combat tours of duty as part of Operation Iraqi Freedom. In Iraq, Dan searched for roadside bombs and his service earned him the Bronze Star for Service, the Army Commendation Medal with Valor, and the Ranger Tab.
                                        
Even as his military duty was ending, Dan felt a new calling to serve children at home as a middle school math teacher and later became an acting Assistant Secretary of Defense in the Pentagon. 

His experiences as a soldier, teacher, and Acting Assistant Secretary of Defense taught him the enormous impact public policy has on the lives of everyday people, and Dan hopes to use that wisdom as a lawmaker.

				<p class=""survey-question"">Please list below 3 key messages of your campaign. What are the main points you want voters to remember about your goals for your time in office?</p>
				<ul class=""key-messages"">
					<li>I will fight for healthcare and prescription drugs that are affordable, accessible, and covers pre-existing conditions for every southern Minnesotan.</li>
					<li>I will fight to end the culture of corruption in Washington where politicians put corporate special interests way ahead of southern Minnesota.</li>

				</ul>
			</div>
							<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What areas of public policy are you personally passionate about?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">In too many communities across southern Minnesota, insurance premiums, co-pays, deductibles, and prescription drugs are too high and access is too limited.  We need to ensure that no family risks bankruptcy from getting the medical treatment they need. In order to do this, we must create a public option so people can buy into a program like Medicare and that will ensure there is greater choice for patients and prevent insurance companies from having localized monopolies. Furthermore, I would work to lower the cost of prescription drugs by fighting to ensure that Medicare can negotiate directly with drug companies and allowing safe generic drugs to compete on a level-playing field against higher-cost 'brand-name' drugs. As the representative of Minnesota's first congressional district, I will push to ensure that healthcare is affordable, accessible, and high-quality for every single southern Minnesotan.

Additionally, I believe that Washington is broken because corporate special interests like multinational oil conglomerates and East Coast pharmaceutical companies have not only purchased a seat at the table, they have completely taken it over, leaving southern Minnesotans to fend for themselves. One campaign contribution after another, their outsized voice has crowded out the needs of southern Minnesotans. That is unacceptable and I will fight to end this corruption in Washington. Because I am refusing all money from these corporate special interests, I am able to fight for </p>

</p><p>As an Iraq War Veteran who served two tours of duty searching for roadside bombs and capturing dangerous insurgents, I have put my life on the line to protect this country and my commitment to national security is as strong today as it has ever been. I know what it takes, have done what it takes, and will do what it takes to keep this country safe. When it comes to public safety, let me be perfectly clear, no matter who you are, if you commit a violent crime, you must be punished.
</p><p>Our immigration system is broken and it is directly a result of the dysfunction in Washington. We must work together towards comprehensive immigration reform that strengthens our borders and our economy.
</p><p>As I speak with farmers, business owners, and community leaders, they are demanding reform to make sure that our economy and communities are vibrant. This means providing a pathway to citizenship for those who pay their taxes and don’t have a criminal record, holding employers who hire undocumented immigrants accountable, and developing a robust guest worker program.
</p><p>We must implement a clear directive through the Department of Homeland Security for ICE, so that our local and state law enforcement agencies are no longer having to supplement the federal government’s role in immigration and customs enforcement.
</p><p>Lastly, I believe that a critical, and often overlooked, component is the need to make a concerted effort to work with other countries to stem the tide of migration under dire circumstances, which has put families and children at significant risk.
</p><p>In Congress, I will work with both parties to achieve the comprehensive immigration reform that is so desperately needed.
</p><p><b>Healthcare</b>
</p><p>Growing up in Red Wing, I knew and could feel that I was part of a community that cared for its neighbors. When someone had a serious illness, the community came together to offer support and prayer. When neighbors faced going bankrupt because of medical bills, the community held potlucks or fundraisers. My community lived by a simple, undeniable creed: “give kindness and take care of each other.”
</p><p>My community has grown over the years, but my responsibilities to it remain the same. That’s why our district must ensure we care for our own and each other, especially when it comes to healthcare. Although we’ve made progress to improve access to coverage, too many Americans are still unable to access the care they need or afford their premiums and out-of-pocket costs. For the health of our neighbors and communities, we must and can do better.
</p><p>Universal Healthcare Coverage
We need to ensure that all Minnesotans can access comprehensive, affordable healthcare. The Affordable Care Act was an important step toward reaching that goal, but our current healthcare system is still leaving too many Minnesotans to fall through the cracks.
</p><p>We need to do better. Accessible and affordable universal healthcare coverage is right for Minnesota. People in our community who are sick should be able to seek care when they need it, and no one in our community should have to choose between paying the medical bills or feeding their family. As your Congressman, I will push to ensure strong, trusted coverage for many more Minnesotans and will work to expand Medicare eligibility age to 55. Additionally, I will join bipartisan efforts to build on the successes of the Affordable Care Act and work to make the individual market, which our farmers, entrepreneurs, and others rely on, more stable and more affordable.
</p><p>Rural Health
We need to make sure that the realities of rural communities are part of health reform discussions and that they have a seat at the table, both to address the challenges they face and learn from their successes. Our rural communities face unique challenges, but also have unique strengths when it comes to providing healthcare.
</p><p>In traveling across our district, I’ve met with countless Minnesotans living in rural areas that don’t have access to local providers or have to drive hours for the care they need. In Congress, I will work to address these growing healthcare workforce shortages and challenges by promoting early exposure to health careers and support programs that recruit and train providers in rural areas. I’ve also heard incredible stories of communities working to address obesity, mental health, or isolation among seniors. I will also push to expand the great innovation happening in our rural communities that provides healthcare, not sick care and that is really making a difference in the patient’s overall health, and the health of the community.
</p><p>Caring for our Veterans
We need to fight for better access to quality healthcare for our veterans and service members. That starts with taking better care of the needs of our active duty service members on the front end and ensuring that we provide VA healthcare benefits to veterans on the back end to recognize the sacrifice and service they have made.
</p><p>Although the VA and TriCare system has shown some improvements over the past decade, particularly in Minnesota, I will work to ensure veterans have access to VA healthcare benefits, and will continue to build on the progress made in providing mental health and chemical dependency services, including for our active duty members and their families.
</p><p>Pharmaceuticals
We need to bring down the skyrocketing price of prescription medications for families across our state. Minnesotans are spending too much of their paychecks on the rising cost of their prescriptions forcing many families to make the difficult choice between paying for needed medications or putting food on the table.
</p><p>Our neighbors, loved ones, and others shouldn’t have to make this choice. There is no single solution to lowering prescription drug prices, a and as a Congressman, I will work to bring down prescription drug prices on many fronts making them affordable and accessible through common-sense reforms focusing on how they are developed, negotiated, and sold. I plan to join colleagues, like Senator Amy Klobuchar, to protect consumers by addressing current anticompetitive practices that prevent the cheaper generic alternative from coming to market. I also will work to increase affordability by allowing Medicare to use its purchasing power and negotiate directly with prescription drug companies.
</p><p>Opioid Crisis
We need to ensure that our approach and support to address addiction and the opioid epidemic reflects the experience of families and our communities.
</p><p>Across our state, we have seen an increase in opioid addiction and opioid related death, which doesn’t begin to tell the story of how loved ones or our community are affected. As Congressman, I will first fight to end the stigma around addiction, ensuring that it is recognized as the disease that it is to help ensure families and individuals are able to access the healthcare services and treatment they need to get well. Secondly, I will focus our efforts across the continuum seeking ways to both prevent, respond, treat, and support long-term recovery of opioid addiction to ensure that across our communities we are developing sustainable solutions that not only address the current crisis, but prevent it from growing or happening in the future.
</p><p><b>National Security</b>
</p><p>I’ve spent much of my career defending our nation – first, in an Army uniform during two Iraq deployments, and then for three and a half years in the Pentagon as an acting Assistant Secretary of Defense. America enjoys safety and security that is unparalleled in the world thanks to our military, intelligence agencies, and other public servants that work tirelessly to keep it that way. Yet, we’ve been a country at war for over 16 years in an unsustainable manner, and face threats around the world.
</p><p>Congressional Action
As a co-equal branch of government, Congress must not cede the responsibility of ultimately putting our military in harm’s way to the President alone. Congress must shape our national security strategy and determine how we use our military, an all-volunteer force, throughout the world. Congress must also check the executive branch from entering into unnecessary conflicts. I will lead the effort to hold the President accountable as Commander-in-Chief to ensure that we only place our service members into harm’s way when it is absolutely necessary.
</p><p>Military Spending and Readiness
When it comes to military spending, I believe that the only way to maintain a strong and sustainable military force without unending costs is to use it more wisely. The cost of the Global War on Terror, beyond the human toll of those that have given their lives in service, will exceed $3 trillion dollars. We can have a strong military when we more judiciously choose when to use it instead of measuring it by its size or its cost. Congress has an enormous role in checking these costs, as well as the costs of a Defense Department, which is still not auditable. I will lead an effort to fund a military that is strong and ready to confront our most dangerous threats, but also a military whose costs do not continually escalate and strain domestic spending. There are more than 48,000 military veterans in Minnesota’s 1st District, many of whom personally and intimately know the consequences of war. They also know that at the end of the day, each service member is measured by their ability to do their job. I will fight for legislation that allows and encourages anyone that can meet the military’s standards to serve, including immigrants and the LGBTQ community. Our military is strongest when it reflects our broader society, and in the age of a 16-year war, we must have the widest net possible to recruit patriotic young people into service.
</p><p>Diplomacy and Cooperation First
The challenges that we face today, both domestic and abroad, are constantly evolving and require a thoughtful and rounded approach to policy-making. I will urge Congress to prioritize our safety at home, defend our allies abroad, and be constantly looking for new partners with whom we can tackle the greatest hurdles in front of us. Our nation will be secure when we holistically approach the dangerous threats that exist in the world through diplomacy, international cooperation, while maintaining a careful balance to address our challenges at home.
</p><p><b>Agriculture</b>
</p><p>From the bluffs overlooking the Mississippi and the valleys of the Driftless Area in the east, to the wide open plains in the west, Minnesota’s First Congressional District is a rich landscape that has created and supported a prosperous tradition of family farming and agriculture. The well-being of our farms and land is directly connected to the prosperity of every town and city in southern Minnesota. That is why it is incumbent upon whoever represents us in Congress to support and expand opportunities for our farmers, and assist in stewardship of the land.
</p><p>Agriculture, Farming, and Our Community
</p><p>The farm economy is the foundation of southern Minnesota. When you travel from county to county, you are exposed to wide range of agricultural production. From small, family farms to regional co-ops, the spirit of community and hard work is embodied in our way of life. However, there is no doubt that the First District is feeling the pressure of an ever-changing economy, an aging workforce, and increased consolidation of farms. The health of our family farms is directly tied to the health of our small towns and cities, and to our soil and water. When elected, you can count on me to be a strong voice for our community in Congress.
</p><p>A Strong Farm Bill
</p><p>If our agricultural way of life is going to thrive for future generations, we must set a course that drives toward success in an uncertain future. This means pursuing a strong Farm Bill that supports family farmers, promotes innovation and stewardship of the land, and provides opportunities for the next generation of farmers. It means investing in technology that allows farmers to be more efficient in their crop production, saving time and costs. It means giving our farmers access to capital and loan forgiveness programs. And it means understanding, grappling with, and adjusting to the environmental impact our farms have on the soil, our communities, and future yields.
</p><p>Healthy Soil and Clean Water
</p><p>I believe farmers and agriculture can be leaders in protecting and improving our natural surroundings. However, the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA) has labeled western and southern Minnesota’s streams and rivers as “most impaired,” stating that only 16 percent meet the standards for aquatic life. Because of rising nitrates, cities like Mankato can no longer draw water from local rivers and farmers have to buy expensive water purifying systems to drink from their wells.
</p><p>I will be a leader in helping farmers steward their land by building healthy soil, using practices like cover crops and diversifying their crop rotations; and I will work with our community to protect our prized landscape and address the emerging water crisis.          
</p><p>New Farmers
</p><p>We must inspire the next generation of farmers to follow in the footsteps of their predecessors. We know that the average age of farmers is on the rise. We can encourage growth in this field and incentivize our youth to pursue careers in agriculture by removing barriers of entry and exposing our children to the opportunities in farming through leadership programs like Future Farmers of America and Land Stewardship Project’s Farm Beginnings initiative.
</p><p>Like Congressman Walz, I will be a champion for beginning farmers by supporting the Beginning Farmer and Rancher Development Program. There are people of all backgrounds who want to farm, and it is critical for our public policy to support those facing particular barriers, including farmers of color and immigrant and refugee farmers.    
</p><p>Transportation
</p><p>Transporting our goods and services to market in a global economy requires an efficient and cost effective transportation system. Inefficiency leads to higher prices for producers. Farmers and agriculture producers rely on roads, bridges, reliable freight rails, and access to barges to ensure that we are able to move commodities to reach major global markets. Investments in our transportation infrastructure, including a WRTA bill that upgrades our locks and dams, are critical to the future of the industry.
</p><p><b>Education and Workforce Development</b>
</p><p>Minnesota’s economic strength is tied directly to the strength of our education systems. As a former teacher and the spouse of a public school educator, I know that there is no more important job than preparing our youth for the future. As a father, I want all southern Minnesotan children to have access to the many pathways to success their life can take from birth to post-secondary education. In Congress, I will fight to maintain strong public education and create better alignment with opportunities in our workforce to help Southern Minnesota economically thrive.
</p><p>In Southern Minnesota in particular, our agriculture, healthcare, and manufacturing industries reach markets around the world. This connection to the global economy affords us the opportunity to drive economic output and world markets, but it also makes us vulnerable to the ever-changing advances in technology and workforce capacity. My vision is for us to not only remain competitive, but to lead. In order to do this, we must be focused on what tomorrow’s landscape looks like and develop an education and workforce system that prepares us for success.
</p><p>80% of the jobs in 2025 don’t even exist yet. We must be forward looking in how we build our education and workforce development apparatus to meet future demand. If we are going to compete in a rapidly evolving, global marketplace we must take action now to ensure our youth today will be successful in this emerging economy. In Congress, I will lead in the following areas:
</p><p>Early Childhood Education
</p>
<ul><li>Accessibility: I support Early Childhood Education as a pathway that gives our children every advantage to develop socially, emotionally, and intellectually. I will work to ensure that there are multiple affordable options for preschool for families within their home communities.</li>
<li>Low cost: I will pursue policies in Congress to ensure that our early childhood educators, especially our child care providers, can still provide critical services at a low cost. I will also work to control the costs of childcare for our working parents, who shouldn’t have to break their bank before their children even start school.</li></ul>
<p>K-12 Education
</p>
<ul><li>Alignment with our economy: I believe that our K-12 education system must prepare our children to be adaptive learners throughout their life in a rapidly evolving economy. Our children must have access to STEM, to the arts, to coding, and to the power that internet connectivity and technology brings to the classroom.</li>
<li>Building partnerships: As a Congressman, I will encourage partnerships between local labor, businesses, technical schooling, apprenticeships, as well as 2 and 4-year degree programs so that each child can be exposed, from an early age, to the many opportunities that already exist right here in our communities. This isn’t just true in manufacturing, but also in healthcare, IT, agriculture, logistics and transportation, aviation, and more. We can be doing a lot more in our education system to help students and their families identify multi-directional educational pathways that can lead to any number of high-wage, high-growth job opportunities available in our communities. There are great models for this youth engagement in our community today, and we know them very well – we know them as FFA and 4-H. Let’s take what we know to be great youth engagement strategies for careers in agriculture, and replicate these models across other industries.</li>
<li>Hands-on training: Let’s teach our kids how to think on their feet and problem solve, how to work in teams and as part of a larger group, expose them to the wonders of modern technology and give them the opportunity to try working with their hands. In Germany, at the age of 10, every student is required to participate in an internship. This shapes their futures well beyond the classroom where they spend the majority of their lives, in the workplace. For this reason, Germany prides itself on one of the lowest youth unemployment rates, where in the U.S. it stands at double that of the national average. We must do better.</li>
<li>Supporting teachers: Great teachers are the lifeblood of our educational system. As the husband of a public school union teacher, I know this well. It’s crucial that we recruit, develop, and retain a strong and diverse teacher workforce. I believe that every classroom must be led and empowered by teachers that are set up for success and compensated for the public service they provide. I will work on creative solutions to recruiting teachers in shortage areas such as STEM, special education, and in our rural communities. I will also support efforts in Congress to make sure teachers can sharpen their skills through ongoing professional development.</li></ul>
<p>Higher Education and Workforce Development
</p>
<ul><li>Post-secondary affordability: When our children pursue a post-secondary education, whether a four-year degree or otherwise, it must fulfill the promise of career enhancement without saddling them with debt. In Congress, I will support legislation that caps student loan rates, that expands the job pathways to loan forgiveness, and will work with all higher education to demand transparency when their prices rise. Our future economy requires our children to be lifetime learners, and we must make sure that every experience they have in education encourages this.<sup id=""cite_ref-quotedisclaimer_1-0"" class=""reference""><a href=""#cite_note-quotedisclaimer-1"">[1]</a></sup></li></ul>"

				<p class=""survey-question"">Who are you? Tell us about yourself in 300 words or less.</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I'm Liam O'Mara, and I'm running for Congress. 
I'm a working-class kid from a union family. My great-grandfather helped found the longshore union, and my dad retired after fifty years on the waterfront. My mother ran a daycare and was an SEIU member. I never expected to go to college, and didn't until I was thirty years old. I've worked as a fry cook, a longshoreman, and a computer nerd. I saved my money, took on loans, and finished a Ph.D. in history. I've been teaching college for twelve years, and my students have taught me a lot about where we are as a society. 
My story is an American story. But it's a lot harder than it used to be, and getting harder. Wages have been stagnant for forty years. Decent housing and a good job are out of reach for many. Health care costs have exploded. But productivity climbs and corporations make record profits. The American Dream is dying, and our politicians have been killing it.
It doesn't have to be this way. Washington used to help balance growth and the needs of society. I'm running to make sure it gets back to work - for all of us.</p>

<ul><li><b>Pro-life</b>: The first inalienable right described in the Declaration of Independence is the right to life, and the job of Congress is to protect our rights, not take them away.

				<p class=""survey-response"">Kathy is most passionate about protecting American taxpayers and individual liberties. Healthcare is the number one concern of most Americans as the costs have skyrocketed and are out of control. We need to address costs through free-market competition and avoid many of the unintended consequences of the ACA. The second concern is the deficit and debt. We need to pass a full budget negotiated by Congress to control the purse strings as the Constitution demands. We also need to make the most of our strong economy by using this time to shore up our bottom line on essential costs like Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid as well as the interest on our debt. Kathy has the training and knowledge to work with others to move these issues forward and solve problems for all Americans.</p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">Who are you? Tell us about yourself in 300 words or less.</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">My name is Melquiades Gagarin. I'm a stay-at-home dad, a community advocate, and a progressive candidate for New York's Sixth Congressional District. I was born in Elmhurst to a Puerto-Rican mother and a Filipino immigrant father. I was raised by my mom, a single parent and 1199SEIU nurse, and my abuela. As a Congressional Aide, I worked across all levels of government to help solve problems for people in the community. I have worked towards advancing gender, racial, and economic justice at organizations such as the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, Planned Parenthood of New York City, and the College and Community Fellowship, as well as at the intersection of all three when working for access to higher education for justice-impacted folks. Recently, I was a field lead for Tiffany Cabán's District Attorney race in Queens.

I'm running to fight for a just future for all people, including those who have been marginalized: the working class, people of color, immigrants, our elders, and our LGBTQIA+ neighbors. I am refusing contributions from corporate PACs, big real estate, fossil fuel, and weapon manufacturers. I live in Kew Gardens with my wife Aleda, our three beautiful children, and our dachshund, Chewbacca.

				<p class=""survey-question"">Please list below 3 key messages of your campaign. What are the main points you want voters to remember about your goals for your time in office?</p>
				<ul class=""key-messages"">
					<li>We need a Congress that will represent and work for all people, champion economic and social justice, take bold action on our climate crisis, prioritize healthcare and housing as fundamental human rights, and work in coalition with those closest to problems when designing policy solutions.   </li>
					<li>For many Americans, the ability to enjoy retirement free of economic insecurity has become increasingly difficult with rising costs of housing and healthcare. We need to expand the social safety net to fill in the current gaps between Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security. As states face a looming pension crisis, more and more families are caught between caring for their elders and providing for the children's futures, while threatening their own retirement plans. A Golden Years Security Act is necessary to care for our elders and to assist families manage long term care costs.</li>
					<li>We are facing a global climate crisis that will require true mass mobilization to effect a Green New Deal. Only bold leadership that is ready to put aside corporate interests and put forth legislation that implements Green New Deal solutions can truly transform our economy and meet the challenges we face. A bold and holistic Green New Deal must work towards intergenerational equity by bolstering labor and providing union jobs and protections, as well as a homes guarantee. </li>
				</ul>
			</div>
							<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What areas of public policy are you personally passionate about?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Our criminal justice system disproportionately punishes and harms black and brown folks, as it, unfortunately, was designed to do. I will fight to end our nation's mass incarceration crisis as well as propose and champion legislation to address the root causes that fuel our system, including ending private prison contracts, passing the REAL Act, and ending the war on drugs.

I worked alongside justice-impacted individuals to eliminate barriers to higher education for currently and formerly incarcerated people. The coalition that I worked with succeeded in introducing the REAL Act in Congress, which would restore Pell Grant access to incarcerated students, and subsequently partnered with the Obama DOE to launch the Pell Pilot Program. That bill is still sitting in Congress, despite studies that show access to higher education while incarcerated leads to lower recidivism rates and improved outcomes for impacted individuals and their families. I will fight for its passage to restore the harm done by the 1994 Crime Bill.

I also fully support legalizing marijuana as well as vacating and expunging all past marijuana-related convictions. Legalized marijuana revenue should be reinvested in the communities that have been most adversely impacted by the War on Drugs and racist \""broken windows\"" policing. Black Americans are four times as likely to get arrested for marijuana as white Americans, despite both populations having similar rates of marijuana use. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What characteristics or principles are most important for an elected official?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">As people, our liberation is bound to one another. When injustice exists, elected officials must have the courage to persevere until all can claim justice. I am running for Congress because too often, thoughts and prayers are given in lieu of leadership. Courage to persevere means taking bold actions, such as legislative protections for the immigrant families being separated at the border. Courage to persevere means doing the diligent and gritty work of leading, even when it's difficult. Ultimately, this means acknowledging that the full potential of any elected office can only be achieved when there are concrete policy solutions to the current economic and racial injustices that exist. Those that want to keep their jobs hide behind platitudes and co-sponsorships; those that uphold their duty present bold ideas and champion them.

					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What is the first historical event that happened in your lifetime that you remember? How old were you at the time?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">The first historical event that happened in my lifetime was the Challenger explosion. However, the most significant was September 11th. The grief I felt for my city was immeasurable. That moment changed me, it changed our country, and it changed the world. I was a 19 year old kid when the war in Afghanistan began. Now I'm 37 years old with three kids of my own, and we have been at war their entire lives. We need to end the forever wars. As a Congressional aide, I worked closely with service members as a liaison to the Department of Veteran's Affairs. As a member of Congress, I will fight for those who have and continue to serve in wars, to ensure the VA is properly funded, and to strengthen mental health programming outreach to servicemembers. </p>

</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What is something that has been a struggle in your life?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I have been very open about struggling with depression and anxiety. We face a mental health crisis, and the lack of public discourse as well as associated stigma leaves many living in the shadows struggling in silence. I have learned to manage my mental health issues and want to use this lived experience to help address the crisis that so many in my generation are faced with. This is part of the reason I will champion true, single-payer Medicare for All that includes access to mental health services, and why unlike my opponent, I won't take money from health giant PACs.
</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Do you believe that it's beneficial for representatives to have previous experience in government or politics?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I believe it's beneficial for representatives to have previous experience to the extent that they understand the political and legislative process, but lived experiences shape how people view problems and solutions. I do have professional experience as a former congressional aide, having represented large parts of the 6th Congressional District. I advocated on the Hill alongside criminal justice reformers and I organized across Queens as part of a movement to build a more just future for the nation's most diverse county. My lived experience as a person of color growing up in a working-class, immigrant family best equips me to understand the struggles Americans are facing today, as well as the policy solutions needed to remedy them.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What do you perceive to be the United States’ greatest challenges as a nation over the next decade?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">One of the United States' greatest challenges as a nation is housing. While an improving economy has benefited real estate and land development corporations, wages are not keeping up with rising housing prices and rent. In Queens alone, countless working families are being priced out of their neighborhoods, and the number of people experiencing homelessness is increasing. 

Housing is a human right. I will fight for guaranteed affordable housing for all and introduce legislation to create millions of new social housing units by 2050 - building upon recommendations by the People's Policy Project and The People's Action Homes Guarantee.

				<p class=""survey-question"">Is there a particular representative, past or present, whom you want to model yourself after?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I'm inspired by Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez for being a bold leader since her first day in office. Her electoral victory, and her policies, embody what a working-class powered movement looks like. The future of Queens, and of our nation, relies on growing that movement, standing up for progressive values, and leading on policies that will bring justice to our communities. I am the only true progressive candidate in New York's Sixth District, prioritizing issues including Affordable Housing for All, true single-payer Medicare for All, the Green New Deal, abolishing ICE, and public banking. I am the only candidate that has signed the Sunrise Movement's No Fossil Fuel Pledge and CODEPINK's pledge to refuse money from weapon manufacturers as well as to divest from war.</p>

No candidate is more devoted to providing affordable, quality education to our children than I am, and my lifelong commitment to education show that. I built my company to help students, mostly public school students, get the education they need to compete in a global economy.
</p><p>For years we’ve listened to politicians say they want to improve education, but nothing changes.
</p><p>Together, we can change it. We have the resources to make American schools among the best in the world, but for too long we haven’t made it a priority. I will work to change that.
</p><p>College tuition should be within the reach of every student. Students should not be burdened by endless college loan debt. Our taxes pay for our state universities, yet many cannot afford to attend them. An educated workforce is the foundation of our economy and our best hope for a prosperous future. In Washington, I will continue my fight for quality education for every child.
</p><p><b>Affordable Healthcare</b><br>
Members of Congress are given excellent healthcare coverage for themselves and their families, yet they refuse to provide the same to us. Representative Woodall happily accepts health care that you pay for, yet he refuses to fix the system for you. Until Congress takes up serious reform to fix our healthcare system, I won’t accept this taxpayer funded benefit until you have access to coverage as well. As a business owner, I have always paid for health coverage for my employees, and as a Member of Congress, I will work to ensure all Americans have access to quality, affordable coverage.
</p><p>For eight years, we heard the cries of repeal of the Affordable Care act, but when the time came, Congress had no plan. Millions of dollars paid by Georgia taxpayers are sent to other states that expanded Medicaid, but because Georgia failed to expand Medicaid, our tax dollars are not even helping our own citizens have access to healthcare. I will vote to expand coverage, better serve the physical and mental health of our Veterans, and work to ensure that a serious medical issue doesn’t have to become a serious financial issue for my fellow Americans. Healthcare is a complicated issue, but we can fix this, and the time to start is now.
</p><p><b>Gun Law Reform</b>
We can protect our rights and find ways to work together on solutions to keep us safe. But we need some common sense. I believe the vast majority of gun owners are safe and responsible gun owners and take their role as good citizens seriously. I believe these responsible gun owners can help us find the solutions that have eluded us for too long.
</p><p>That’s why when I’m elected to Congress I promise to reach across the aisle and work with responsible gun owners to find cultural, technological, and legal ways that we can make this country safer for everyone, but it’s not going to be easy. No matter what side of this issue you’re on, we have to stop addressing this issue from a place of anger and fear, and start discussing it with facts and respect for our fellow Americans. There are no easy answers when it comes to making our families safer from gun violence, but if we work together we will find that there are innovations and common sense solutions hiding in plain sight.
</p><p>I will vote to pass reasonable gun reform: universal background checks to keep guns out of the hands of violent criminals and domestic abusers, methods to prevent anyone on a terrorist watch list–or whose mental health poses a danger to themselves and others– from accessing weapons, and measures designed to keep our children safe. Congress has been silent too long.
</p><p><b>Protecting Medicare and Social Security</b><br>
We need to do more to protect our most vulnerable citizens, and I will lead the charge in Washington to do just that. The government never hesitated to take money out of your paycheck; now government must keep its word when it comes to healthcare, Social Security, and Medicare. Instead, your benefits are threatened by the reckless spending of Congress.
</p><p>To our senior citizens:you earned and paid for your benefits, and I will never vote to break that contract. We have seen Washington tap into the Social Security Trust Fund, putting every American at risk of losing benefits. We have seen them run up huge deficits and then cry for a balanced budget. This must stop.
</p><p>The best indicator of character is how you treat people who can’t offer you anything in return.I will bring compassionate leadership back to Washington.
</p><p><b>Fiscal Responsibility</b><br>
We listened to the promises of Republicans to put our fiscal house in order and give tax relief to working families. Despite their promises, they increased the deficit by over 2 trillion dollars just in the last two months. Very simply put, we are borrowing trillions from China and letting our children deal with the consequences. By the time my daughter reaches middle school, the national debt will be more than 30 trillion dollars. This is fiscal insanity, coming from people who call themselves conservatives.
</p><p>We should be focused on building a better future. I will support renewed investment in national infrastructure, protections for our vulnerable electric grid, and making sure we never again leave over three million Americans without power or water for months as we did in Puerto Rico. I support ideas to let younger Americans consolidate their student loan debt–or have it forgiven in exchange for public service–so that they can become full participants in the American economy. And I will support tax reform that benefits working families and small businesses instead of giveaways for billionaires and corporate welfare.
</p><p>For too long Congress has refused to spend OUR money on the things we need, and I will do better. I will vote to restore fiscal responsibility, and I will vote to stop spending our children’s inheritance.
</p><p><b>Immigration Reform</b><br>
In March, I sat down with several Dreamers to hear their stories. One Dreamer, Aldo Mendoza-Guerra, said “The place we were born is foreign to us. The place we were raised looks at us like foreigners.” Over 80% of Americans want to protect the Dreamers; they came to this country as children through no fault of their own and are as American as anyone born on this soil.
</p><p>We have not had immigration reform since Ronald Reagan was president. The world has changed but we remain stuck in the failed policies of the past while millions continue to live in the shadows. We can protect our borders, maintain our national security and join together to address this pressing issue. We cannot allow fear to drive policy.
</p><p>I will vote to protect the Dreamers and to give them a path to citizenship. I will vote to enable those who want to contribute to our great American melting pot to come here legally and safely. The state of immigration in the United States is a human tragedy that is destroying innocent lives and threatening the education, employment, and safety of young people. Enough is enough. If we want to be seen as a country of great opportunity, we must start acting like one, and I will make it my priority to lead the charge for smarter immigration laws.
</p><p><b>Women’s Rights</b><br>
The Republicans have mounted an unprecedented attack on the rights of women. While we hear Republicans call for less government and more personal freedom, we watch them try to restrict women’s rights, to limit life-saving research, and to withhold funding for organizations like Planned Parenthood that treat thousands of women each year. The decision to have a child is a sacred decision only a woman can make. Why does the party of individualism and small government want to control your body?
</p><p>I led by example in my company, C2 Education, and I will do the same in Washington. Women always received equal pay for equal work, were hired and promoted because of their abilities, and all employees received paid medical leave. I worked hard to make sure women felt safe and respected in the workplace. I will continue to fight for your right to equal healthcare, equal pay, and equal representation.
</p><p><b>Environmental Protection</b><br>
Too many in Congress are preventing us from developing safer, cleaner and cheaper energy. We are the most innovative nation on earth, yet we are missing out on hugely profitable advancements in clean energy.
</p><p>Let’s put our communities to work to make us more energy efficient, grow our economy, and to protect our planet from the special interests who don’t care about our future. The United States should lead the world in the development of smart development, clean energy, and “green-collar” jobs. We can create thousands of jobs, and put people to work protecting our environment, building clean alternative energy sources, and securing a place for America as a global leader in the green revolution.
</p><p><b>Net Neutrality</b><br>
The Federal Communications Commission voted to end net neutrality, meaning your equal access to the open Internet that has become a mainstay in everyone’s life is at risk. If Congress does not act, net neutrality is history and your open access to millions of web sites and services will be cut off unless you pay to play. Congress could stop this from happening, but, like so much else, they do nothing. Equal access to knowledge is essential to a prosperous, equitable future. I was the first candidate to speak out forcefully and take a strong position on net neutrality, and as your representative, I will champion our right to an internet that is open to all.
</p><p><b>Georgia Agriculture and Our Family Farms</b><br>
The family farm is the backbone of America. Here in Georgia agriculture is our largest industry. Our farmers compete in a world market where the playing field is not level and the price of commodities is not based on the cost of production. I believe in parity for our producers, and open markets for our products.
</p><p>The President has said that he believes a trade war will be good for our economy, but in reality, it will hurt farmers and devastate rural communities. Closed markets drive down the prices of all our agricultural products by limiting demand. If we lose our ability to sell to other countries, we risk never getting our market share again. I will work to protect our farmers and our rural communities and keep our agricultural economy strong by promoting fair trade partnerships, open markets, and financial support for our growers.

</p><p>Healthcare is a mess. Obamacare was a disaster, and now the Democrats are doubling down on it by pushing a single-payer system that would cost $32 trillion over the next decade.
</p><p>As an emergency physician who treats patients regardless of their insurance status, Dr. Rich McCormick is infinitely familiar with the costs of healthcare and understands that a single-payer healthcare system would be the biggest step the nation could take toward socialism. His unique experience in healthcare and in government spending make him the ideal candidate to find solutions for patient care and defend against the socialist agenda which would rob patients of access to and quality of services.
</p><p>To fix healthcare and make it more affordable and accessible, it’s time to send a physician, not a politician, to Washington. In congress, Rich will champion patient-centered healthcare solutions:
</p>
<ul><li>Protect those with pre-existing conditions</li>
<li>End surprise medical billing</li>
<li>Slash federally-mandated paperwork that robs physicians of time with patients</li>
<li>Stop socialized medicine that would eliminate 160 million private insurance plans</li></ul>
<p><b>BORDERS SECURED</b>
</p><p>During his time as a Marine aviator and Naval Commander, Rich served in combat zones in Afghanistan, the Middle East, and Africa. He saw America’s force for good in those regions, and understands why people want to move to our nation to create a better life for their families.
</p><p>But as someone who swore an oath to defend our nation’s constitution, Rich firmly believes that those wanting to immigrate here must follow the laws of our nation and do so legally.
</p><p>To stop violent criminal immigrants from entering our country and combat the flow of illicit drugs and child trafficking Rich will:
</p>
<ul><li>Build the barriers needed to secure the border</li>
<li>Provide Border patrol with more resources, technologies, and manpower</li>
<li>Identify and deport violent, criminal illegal immigrants</li></ul>
<p><b>OPPORTUNITY RESTORED</b>
</p><p>Raised by a single mother, Dr. Rich McCormick got his first job in middle school as a paperboy and by the age of 16 became a bus boy and cook. He worked his way through college and through hard work, he was able to obtain his share of the American Dream.
</p><p>Rich wants to ensure his kids and all our families have that same opportunity. As congressman, Rich will work to empower the private sector while stopping the slide towards socialism.
</p>
<ul><li>Double down on President Trump’s tax cuts</li>
<li>Dismantle the job-killing regulatory state</li>
<li>Promote entrepreneurship and innovation to grow the economy</li></ul>
<p><b>AMERICA STRENGTHENED</b>
Rich swore an oath to defend this nation against all enemies, foreign and domestic.
</p><p>As someone who sacrificed time with family to serve during times of war, Rich knows the critical importance of building a lethal military force that can defend our national security at a moment’s notice.
</p><p>In Congress, Rich will continue upholding the oath he took, just as he did in his service in combat zones, ensuring America and her allies are secure. He will ensure that our nation keeps its promise to our veterans when they come home.
</p>
<ul><li>Restore America’s military might</li>
<li>Protect America’s interests first</li>
<li>Deliver better healthcare to veterans</li></ul>
<p><b>FAITH RENEWED</b>
</p><p>Rich is wholly invested in supporting his family, serving his faith, and building a community right here in Gwinnett and Forsyth. Most importantly, he will remain a local resident after the election is over because Rich knows that strong families and communities require long-term personal investments.  
</p><p>Rich is committed to creating a culture of health and wellness in our community. As an ER doctor, he’s treated too many overdose victims and seen too many lives devastated by drug addiction. As the head of the Polypharmacy Multidisciplinary Committee at Camp Lejeune Naval Medical Center, he wrote and helped enforce policy that reduced the number of concerning polysubstance abusers by over 65% in one year.  
</p><p>Rich believes that investing in the youth of America is an investment in the future. He has been active in youth ministry for over 25 years. As a physician and student leader, he has seen how human trafficking and sexual abuse has devastated not just families, but entire communities. Domestic violence is a reality that Dr. McCormick treats all too often and he recognizes the need to support outreach and advocacy groups throughout the district.
</p><p>Rich is prepared to tackle the tough challenges facing our community.
</p>
<ul><li>Combat opioid abuse and help those struggling with addictions find treatment</li>
<li>End the scourge of human trafficking and punish traffickers</li>
<li>Support and assist those sheltering and protecting the defenseless</li>
<li>Protect life at every stage, from the unborn to the infirmed</li></ul>
<p><b>RIGHTS PROTECTED</b>
</p><p>As a Marine aviator and Naval Commander, Rich swore an oath to defend the Constitution. He knows that the Constitution is crystal clear in guaranteeing the rights of responsible citizens to arm and protect themselves with a firearm.
</p><p>Rich will also stand up to the radical socialists in Congress and advance the principles that made America the greatest, most prosperous nation in the world. He will always rely on free market principles to grow the economy, not government.
</p>
<ul><li>Protect the rights of law-abiding gun owners</li>
<li>Defend the Constitution and Religious liberty</li>
<li>Stop the Slide towards Socialism<sup id=""cite_ref-quotedisclaimer_15-0"" class=""reference""><a href=""#cite_note-quotedisclaimer-15"">[15]</a></sup></li></ul>"

</p><p>I’m running because our faith, our freedoms and our values are under assault from coastal elites and leftists like Nancy Pelosi and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. 
</p><p>I am running because America is worth fighting for. I’m a fighter. I’ve overcome great adversity. I will be a strong voice for faith, family &amp; freedom.  
</p><p>HEALTH CARE 
</p><p>I believe patients and doctors, certainly not government bureaucrats, should be in charge of health care decisions. 
</p><p>I’m for expanding choice and competition in our health care system.
</p><p>I strongly oppose the Democrats’ plans to create socialized medicine.  
</p><p>IMMIGRATION
</p><p>We lawfully admit over a million immigrants each year, which far exceeds other countries. But, our immigration system is in crisis. We need to secure our borders and we need the rule of law. I oppose the continued allowance of sanctuary cities. 
</p><p>TAXES
</p><p>I oppose tax increases. We don’t need more taxes. Government takes enough of our hard-earned money. Each of our families live within their means, and we must demand the same of our government.
</p><p>LIFE
</p><p>I am pro-life. Each of us have an inalienable, God given right to life. The first responsibility of the government is to protect its citizens, including those who are pre-born.
</p><p>DEBT
</p><p>Our debt is unsustainable. Congress has run up the debt to the tune of $23 trillion and it is adding $1 trillion to our debt each year. That equates to $66,000 for every man, woman, and child.
</p><p>REFORMING CONGRESS
</p><p>Mark Meadows did not run to be a politician, he ran to reform congress. I am running to continue his great work. We need a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution and we need term limits for Members of Congress.
</p><p>2ND AMENDMENT
</p><p>As an owner of several firearms, I support our Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms.
</p><p>NATIONAL SECURITY
</p><p>The world is a dangerous place. President Reagan rightfully showed the world that America is safe when America’s defense is strong. Defending our national security is not optional. 
</p><p>VETERANS 
</p><p>America must keep the promises we have made to its veterans. They are our heroes and as such deserve our thanks and the best health care available.<sup id=""cite_ref-quotedisclaimer_26-0"" class=""reference""><a href=""#cite_note-quotedisclaimer-26"">[26]</a></sup>

Growth and prosperity require an economy that supports innovation and entrepreneurship. We must have a tax and regulatory environment that rewards entrepreneurs and prioritizes small businesses. This means helping to facilitate access to early capital, small business loans, and funding programs that invest in innovative businesses, especially for groups who have historically been discriminated against in banking practices.
</p><p><b>Healthcare</b><br>
The United States is in a health care crisis. Americans now pay twice as much as any other developed nation for their health care, but for the first time in a century, life expectancy has declined for 3 straight years. ⅔ of all bankruptcies are caused by medical costs. Before arguing about specific health care proposals, we must all agree on the two basic problems: cost of health care in America is too high and tens of millions of people still don’t have access. Any serious health care plan must bring down the cost of medical treatment, especially prescription drugs, guarantee that patients with pre-existing conditions will never lose coverage, and ensure that no one in this country is uninsured. Congress should consider any proposal that addresses these issues, regardless of ideology.
</p><p><b>Money in Politics</b><br>
Middle class families’ voices are being left out of the political process. Powerful special interest groups with unlimited amounts of money undermine our democracy. Texans are tired of the partisan dysfunction and the corrupting influence of money in politics. I will work every day to stand up for Texas families. I am refusing corporate PAC money in this campaign, instead I am building a campaign powered by people, and I look forward to fighting for real campaign finance reform in Congress.
</p><p><b>Veterans</b><br>
We must do better when it comes to taking care of our veterans and the families who support them. We must increase job training programs to ensure that we can better translate skills learned and mastered in the military to private industry. We have to continue to improve access to health services by expanding the VA, making it more efficient, and taking advantage of new technology, like telehealth, to get more veterans care. Mental health is a serious crisis and improved counseling and treatment for TBIs should be a priority.
</p><p>Veterans returning home also pose unique challenges for families, who should also have access to job training, child care, and counseling needed to confront these challenges.
</p><p><b>Criminal Justice Reform</b><br>
Our prisons and jails are full of nonviolent drug offenders and people who are incarcerated because they can’t afford a fine or bond. This overburdens our criminal justice system and disproportionately impacts communities of color. We must reform sentencing, ensure those who are incarcerated are rehabilitated and prepared to reenter society, reduce recidivism and end the 50-year failed war on drugs, which has treated a medical problem with a criminal justice solution.
</p><p><b>Energy and the Environment</b><br>
Our energy and environmental policy must be based on scientific evidence and economic realities, not partisan ideology. Texas’ economy depends on a thriving oil and natural gas industry, and a rapidly expanding renewable sector. To maintain our status as America’s leading energy producer, we must continue to invest in renewable and nuclear infrastructure. Texas already leads the nation in wind energy, with wind turbine technician listed as the fastest growing job in the state, and we can be a future leader in solar energy, creating tens of thousands of new green jobs for our economy.
</p><p>Climate change is not a hoax. It is our defining global challenge, and threatens our economy and our national security. The Houston area has seen five 500-year floods in five years, and extreme weather patterns across the globe are intensifying. We must take evidence-based action on climate change, including targeted interventions as well as creating incentives that reduce carbon emissions.
</p><p><b>Gun Violence</b><br>
Gun violence is a public health crisis and Congress has failed to do its job to keep families safe. We must respect the second amendment of the Constitution that protects law-abiding gun owners’ ability to purchase firearms while dealing with the reality that gun violence and mass shootings have created an atmosphere of terror for Texas children and families. Common sense gun reforms can accomplish both of these goals, including: common sense background checks, red flag laws, locker laws, getting weapons off our streets and getting guns out of the hands of violent criminals and domestic abusers.
</p><p><b>Retirement Security</b><br>
People who have worked their entire lives and paid in to Medicare and Social Security should be able to retire in dignity, without being forced to pay for the fiscal irresponsibility of Washington. Under the current Administration, the deficit has exploded to over $1 trillion. In order to pay for this unprecedented debt expansion, cuts to Medicare and Social Security for middle class retirees have been proposed. This is an immoral transfer of wealth away from the middle class and should be opposed.
</p><p><b>Education</b><br>
Public education is essential for a functioning democracy and a competitive economy. Our children deserve equal access to educational opportunity and our country must have an educated workforce capable of handling the challenges of the 21st century. America invested in a primary and secondary public education system in the 19th Century that helped drive our economy. In today’s America, every child should have access to quality education, including Universal Pre-K, regardless of their zip code. In order to be competitive with other nations, we must also make necessary investments in higher education, including community college, vocational training, and ensure that any hard-working student can graduate from public universities without a mountain of debt.

					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What areas of public policy are you personally passionate about?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">States rights have been restricted by the ratification of the 17th Amendment. I will propose legislation to repeal the 17th Amendment to end popular vote for Senators and return the responsibility to the State Legislators. By doing so the States would then have their voice back at a Federal level ending much of the Federal Governments over reach.

Revise the immigrations and asylum laws requiring anyone that does not enter the United States via a Port of Entry to be removed immediately. Move Federal Immigration Judges back under the Judicial branch . Currently removal orders and warrants are not legally binding to State and local Law Enforcement. Doing so will make entering the United States illegally an enforceable crime. Anyone that enters the United States illegally be deported within 7 days of apprehension. No path to Citizenship for DACA only resident alien status.

Experience in government or politics is not a qualifcation and should not be required. People that have long political careers tend to be the most corrupt bring those bad habits with them. I do think that military experiance should be a requirement. Most people that have served in the military have learned to work with people that they may not agree with or even like but because they look for the most efficant way to complete a task and are able to work through their differance for the greater good.  </p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">What do you perceive to be the United States’ greatest challenges as a nation over the next decade?</p>

					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">If you are not a current representative, are there certain committees that you would want to be a part of?</p>

			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Do you believe that two years is the right term length for representatives?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">A two year term is to short currently we only get about 9 months of work from a represenative in the span of the term. After the end of their first year in office they begin spending the bulk of their time campaigning for reelection. A 3 or 4 year term would force them to actually have to work for the people. If they decide to run for a higher office they must resign to run for that office. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Do you believe that two years is the right term length for representatives?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Representatives should be elected to a four year term with a two term limit.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What are your thoughts on term limits?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Senators should be limited to two terms
Representatives should be limited to eight years 
Supreme Court should not be a lifetime appointment twelve years appointments</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What are your thoughts on term limits?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Term limits must be enacted for all elected officials people in positions of power become corrupt as time goes on. Limiting all offices to 12 years including appointed offices like the Supreme Court. </p>

<p>I am running for Congress as an Independent because I have heard the concerns of the people of El Paso and am tired of both the Democrats and Republicans letting us down. Let's face it, neither the Democrats nor Republicans have our best interests at heart. The parties only pretend to care about the people at election time and are more concerned about the party platform or what the lobbyists desire. We have been promised change for the better from almost everyone involved in government with none of them ever coming through for us. They hold us hostage on every issue. Whether it's taxes, immigration, or veteran's concerns, it's all ignored until election season rolls around. To sink even lower, both parties are too busy insulting each other and voting down party lines instead of coming together with a real solution for America. Finally, after the bickering has toned down, all that we are left with is higher taxes and more wars. These games are not what made America the country we all love. This needs to stop.
</p><p>I and millions of Americans believe it is time for us to take back control of our country. As an Independent I will work directly for you the people. I will do everything in my power to present to the people of El Paso every piece of legislation that is to voted upon and then take action. When was the last time a member of Congress asked you which way to vote on a particular piece of legislation and followed through?
</p><p>During this congressional session there have been over 6000 pieces of legislation drafted by members of Congress. Of those proposed, less than 200 have been voted into a law. My best estimate is that 75% of the bills introduced are not necessary are are designed to bog the system down and stall any real progress resulting in passing legislation that only benefits the special interests. We can't allow this to continue. I will strive to end the strife between the parties and work to get real results for the people of El Paso and the rest of the United States.
</p><p>El Paso, the Democrats have represented us in Congress for decades and all that we have to show for it is high taxes and poorly paid jobs. Our military veterans are not receiving the proper care that they need, our largest school district is nearly bankrupt, our children are not being properly educated, and our border is riddled with issues. I want for my family the same thing that you want for yours; an opportunity in my own city to prosper and watch my family grow and be successful. Voting for the Democrats and Republicans will prove to change nothing for our beautiful city. Voting for an Independent will mean that you are voting for a representative who works to satisfy a party's requirements, but instead works directly for you, the people who own the government.
</p><p>We have a chance to make real changes to our city. Let's not waste another opportunity on voting for a career politician who only seeks personal gain. Vote for someone who wants to make El Paso a place of prosperity for all of us! Vote for me, Sam Williams for Congress. Together we can take El Paso to another level!<sup id=""cite_ref-quotedisclaimer_3-0"" class=""reference""><a href=""#cite_note-quotedisclaimer-3"">[3]</a></sup>

</p><p>Our Veterans
</p><p>Our veterans offered their lives to protect and defend our nation from its enemies. We can never do enough to demonstrate our gratitude for their devout patriotism, their sacrifice and their service.
As a grateful nation, it is our obligation to do everything in our power so that when these brave souls return home, they have access to the best possible healthcare, good paying jobs, continuing education and vocational training, affordable housing and other support systems. We must demand that the Department of Veterans Affairs be held accountable so that our retired servicemen and women receive the very best possible their country has to offer. The manner in which we care for our veterans must always reflect our nation’s profound appreciation for their service.
</p><p>National Security
</p><p>Since 911, our nation and its allies are facing increasing security threats from every sector of the globe. America, as the leader of the free world, must continue to provide strong leadership abroad.
If we wish to protect and expand our democratic influence around the world, we must maintain strong and fully-funded military forces. Unfortunately, after years of cuts and neglect across all branches of our Armed Forces, our proud men and women in uniform are now left with the formidable task of protecting our nation, in spite of serious gaps in military readiness.
I will work tirelessly to rebuild our military to ensure that our servicemen and women receive the necessary equipment, training, and support they need to successfully complete their missions.
</p><p>Public Safety
</p><p>Our nation’s most important responsibility is keeping its citizens free and safe. We must ensure that our local law enforcement has the necessary resources to protect our cities, communities and neighborhoods. Our public safety is paramount to the stability of our country.
I am a firm believer in the 2nd Amendment. Although we must continue to protect this fundamental Constitutional right, we must find ways to keep guns out of the hands of those who should never have them – namely children, criminals, and the mentally ill. As Congresswoman, I will strongly support solutions that concentrate on gun safety, including improving school resource officer training, universal background checks, and effectively closing loopholes that allow criminals to have access to firearms, while preserving the integrity of all our rights as Americans. Protecting our children from any type of harm will be one of my highest priorities as a public servant. No family should ever have to endure the tragedy of a school shooting. To ensure their safety, one of my first acts as Congresswoman, I will introduce legislation to create an Early Intervention and Prevention Center (EIPC) in every public school in the country with the task of identifying mental health issues in our students before they become critical and lead to tragic consequences.
</p><p>Life
</p><p>As a Christian and a mother, I believe in a culture that values and nurtures all life from birth to natural death. As your Congresswoman, I will protect the life of the unborn and also the life and health of the mother. I oppose tax-payer funding for late-term abortions. I understand that, in some cases, the termination of a pregnancy—ectopic pregnancy, rape, and incest, may dangerously affect the health of the mother as determined by her physician. My votes will consistently protect life, and I will work to ensure that abortions become the exception, not the rule. We must oppose the culture of death. I do understand that, sometimes, difficult and painful decisions will have to be made which might lead to the termination of a pregnancy.
</p><p>Likewise, I will always stand by the elderly and work so that as they enter their golden years, they do so with the dignity, care and support they so greatly deserve. Ensuring their quality of life will always be one of my highest priorities as your Congresswoman.
</p><p><b>PROSPER</b>
</p><p>The Economy
</p><p>I will always support any legislative measure that puts more money in the pockets of the middle class. The Republican Tax Cut law was the right thing to do for our economy and our struggling middle class. I also believe, that tax cuts, combined with fewer regulations, have led to the explosive growth of our economy. As your elected representative, I will work with my colleagues to ensure that the tax cut law becomes permanent for everyone, not just corporations. The reduction in the corporate tax rate has been very beneficial to the U.S. economy and job growth, but we must also ensure that the corporations pay their fair share of taxes by closing current loopholes that have allowed them in the past to pay less than required. I will also work hard to attract investments to South Florida, including strengthening the industries that drive our dynamic economy – particularly tourism, business, and international trade – by investing and improving our infrastructure—roads, public transportation, and traffic flow.
</p><p>Our local economy is driven by our small businesses, who employ the majority of our residents. We must help these small businesses grow by allowing them to invest and create more high paying jobs. I believe that our government does more when it involves itself less in our markets and leaves the business of job growth for our job creators. In the 1980s, Ronald Reagan described his goal for his tax reform initiatives as ‘fairness, simplicity and economic growth’ and that vision remains applicable today.
</p><p>Healthcare 
</p><p>With Obamacare premiums expected to rise by at least 17% in Florida, many families in our communities are gravely concerned on how they will be able to afford health insurance now and in the future. The current system is simply not working. I am determined to protect South Florida families from mounting costs by reforming our broken healthcare system with cost-effective and patient-centered solutions. Specifically, we need to go after the $95 billion in annual waste, fraud and abuse; give individuals and businesses the right to purchase health insurance across state lines; and repeal crushing Obama-era taxes and needless regulations, while ensuring that the neediest among us have access to affordable, quality healthcare.
</p><p>South Floridians deserve better! I am dedicated to bringing patient-oriented reforms to Washington that will work for hard-working American families.
</p><p>Traffic &amp; Transportation
</p><p>The quality of life of the residents in our district could be significantly improved in several ways, one of which has to do with reducing the traffic flow problems that are threatening to paralyze our county. In addition, few know that our major traffic arteries—826, I-95, and 836—are managed and operated by different authorities, each responding to its own interests independently of each other. Add to this the political rivalries that exists in our community that have derailed any real effort to bring to this county a public transportation and road systems worthy of our community. This lack of coordination and cooperation between local, state, and federal authorities has – for decades – made it impossible to develop a coherent and practical plan to expand and improve our highways, roads, and public transportation systems (Metrorail in particular). Politics as usual, poor planning, and coordination has cost South Florida millions in federal dollars that are badly needed to solve the traffic and transportation crisis that affects all of us. It is shameful and intolerable that your commute to work will take almost an hour and half each way – every day! And all because we have failed to present a united front in Washington that could make a strong case for why South Florida badly needs and deserves federal transportation dollars. If Boston or Chicago can have a first-rate public transportation system, why can’t Miami, one of the busiest and most culturally diverse cities in the nation! We can and must do better for the betterment of our community… and with me in Congress you will get it!
</p><p><b>STRENGTHEN</b>
</p><p>Immigration
</p><p>Washington has failed to find a permanent solution to our immigration crisis. For too long, our approach to immigration has been piecemeal and mostly driven by executive orders. But this has not worked. What we need is an Immigration Reform Plan that addresses the problem on all fronts. We must tackle border security in a humane manner – without separating families – swiftly remove criminal aliens and correct visa overstay, while establishing a work authorization for the undocumented and a permanent solution for DACA recipients.
It is also important that we have an honest conversation with Central American nations with the goal of identifying solutions that will stem the wave of immigrants seeking asylum in the U.S. Any assistance we provide to these countries should be tied to actions and, most importantly, measurable outcomes that bring about the kind of changes and transformation that will make it worth for the citizens of those nations to stay in their home country.
</p><p>Israel
</p><p>Our nation’s close ties with Israel should be honored and protected. As our closest ally in the Middle East and the region’s only true free market democracy – we should stand by Israel. They’re right to exist should never be put in Jeopardy by threats from terrorists or Iran. As Congresswoman, you can count on me to stand by our allies, especially Israel.<sup id=""cite_ref-quotedisclaimer_2-0"" class=""reference""><a href=""#cite_note-quotedisclaimer-2"">[2]</a></sup>

				<p class=""survey-question"">Who are you? Tell us about yourself in 300 words or less.</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I am a successful small business owner and native Californian. Throughout my childhood I have moved from California to New York and back. I am a wife, a mother, a citizen and A Candidate for California's 6th Congressional District. Like you I have watched career Politician's work to keep their jobs and ignore the needs of our community. I am tired of waiting for someone to represent me! I am a passionate supporter of our Constitution and the Responsibilities that comes with our Rights. I support law enforcement, our military and the rule of law.  I strongly support protection of our environment and the duty to be a steward of the land.  I am a licensed Realtor with a background in financial Investigations, with over 16 years of experience in the Sacramento area real estate market. I work personally with the people in the District and an have intimate knowledge of the needs for our community from safe drinking water and schools to the needs of low income citizens and affordable housing. I am an ordinary citizen, I shop in local stores and drive the same crumbling roads as my neighbors. I have a plan to fix our community.
 </p>
			</div>
						    <div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Please list below 3 key messages of your campaign. What are the main points you want voters to remember about your goals for your time in office?</p>
				<ul class=""key-messages"">
					<li>CLEAN WATER We have the tools to provide safe clean water to our community and I have the will to use them. </li>
					<li>EDUCATION  Parents have the right to choose Charter Schools, Private Schools, and Homeschooling.  I believe schools are a place for children to learn to read, to write and express themselves without being subjected to social engineering. </li>
					<li>SENIORS  Our seniors like our children are a valuable resource. I pledge to help my elders keep their homes and have the ability to stay independent and afford food and medicines.  </li>
				</ul>
			</div>
							<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What areas of public policy are you personally passionate about?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">CLEAN WATER -
While all politicians claim to want clean, safe water their actions speak loader then words. We have not been told the truth about the ground water contamination in our district. My opponent has ignored the problem for to many years. She has ignored the homeless crises and the human waste that is poisoning our rivers and streams. We have the tools to provide safe clean water to our community and I have the will to use them. 
EDUCATION 
Parents have the right to choose Charter Schools, Private Schools, and Homeschooling. I oppose Common Core standards that try to force a one-size-fits-all approach to educating our children. I believe schools are a place for children to learn to read, to write and express them. Our schools have become breeding ground for socialism and liberal agendas. It is long overdue that schools go back to basics to guarantee our children opportunities for a better life and to effectively compete against foreign workers.
SENIORS 
Our seniors like our children are a valuable resource. The wisdom and experience they offer can no longer be ignored or taken for granted. In my career in real estate I see firsthand how seniors are forced to choose between having a home while sacrificing food and medicine. They are treated like pawns used to maintain power. I pledge to help my elders keep their homes and have the ability to stay independent and afford food and medicines. It is our obligation to care for our seniors while preserving their dignity</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Who do you look up to? Whose example would you like to follow, and why?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I look up Margret Thatcher. She was strong, independent  and had a great sense of humor.  I am strive to be like Theodore Roosevelt. He said \""It is hard to fail, but it is worse never to have tried to succeed.\"" ...   I have never let \""NO\"" stand in my way.  I learned to consider the consequences of my actions and try to think first and not be swayed by emotion. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Is there a book, essay, film, or something else you would recommend to someone who wants to understand your political philosophy?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">the writing of Thomas Jefferson, John Lock, John Adams.. Atlas Shrugged. I love American History,  I believe we learn more from our mistakes and losses as well as success.  I thrive on stories of life and liberty.  The Darkest Hour and the Kings Speech would be recent movies. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What characteristics or principles are most important for an elected official?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I want someone that is stern with a strong personality. Someone grounded in their conviction but not blinded with arrogance. You must be able to speak  publically, accept constructive criticism without being thin skinned while trusting your instincts.  Running for office is not for the faint of heart. The willingness to listen to opposing points of view and make informed decisions is the making of a great leader.  Hiding your agenda to avoid conflict is a red flag of what we don't need. Making excuses for towing the party line and falling asleep at work on National TV is sign to get out.  Keeping the job to keep the job doesn't benefit the citizens of the District. The job cannot be the reason for holding the office, the desire to serve your community and fight for the people that  trust you to make decisions that serve not only the district, but the state and the country.  At some point you must have the character to stand up to your party to do the right thing</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What qualities do you possess that you believe would make you a successful officeholder?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I have a positive- can do attitude.  I am creative and a problem solver. I connect with people on a personal level. Most people want to be herd and I am a listener. II have integrity and a servant's heart.  I am an effective communicator. In my business I don't expect anyone to do something I am not willing to do myself.  I can be steadfast or flexible when called on.  I am confident, never arrogant and respect the value of work regardless of the job or occupation. 
To hold office you need to accept people from every walk of life. I don't want to be tolerated, no one does. We want to be understood even if we disagree.
</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What do you believe are the core responsibilities for someone elected to this office?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">First and foremost you must be available to hear the concerns of your constituents. You must spend as much time as possible with the people that elect you, You must live in the community you represent.  That's not vicariously through staffers and polls. Drop into a school board meeting,  visit seniors and shelters. You must know who you represent in some cases put your personal views to the side to do what is best for the district. As a representative of the people you must be able to say no to special interest and the money that comes with it to do the right thing. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What legacy would you like to leave?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">That I made a positive difference in peoples lives and made the world a little better. I want to be an example to my children and grandchildren. We all matter and life is not about power of money, its about love and time and what we do with it. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What is the first historical event that happened in your lifetime that you remember? How old were you at the time?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Jimmy Carter plunged us into a gas shortage. My parents had to line up for hours to get gas on odd or even days based on the last number of the car license plate.  4th Grade 9 or 10 years old. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What was your very first job? How long did you have it?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I was 8 years old working in my fathers restaurant after school and weekends. I filled salt and pepper shakers, wiped down menu's and rolled silverware for wait staff.  I did this job on and off over the years until the last family restaurant sold around 1992.  If your family owns a restaurant you have that job for life. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What is your favorite book? Why?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">The Red Badge of Courage.  It's about life and what we learn about ourselves on our journey. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">If you could be any fictional character, who would you want to be?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Wonder Woman - She is a beautiful, brilliant bad-ass with a loving heart. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What was the last song that got stuck in your head?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Sailing by Chris Cross</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What is something that has been a struggle in your life?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">weight! I have be thin and chubby, thin is better.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What qualities does the U.S. House of Representatives possess that makes it unique as an institution?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">To maintain our sovereignty against people who refuse to appreciate our great society and the freedom we possess.  We have an obligation to oppose those that would hide our past, good and bad, to control our future.   Carl Sagan said \""You have to know the past to understand the present.\"" I would expand that quote to read \""You have to know the past to understand the present and pave a path to the future.\""

It is truly the Peoples house. It is made up of citizens from every corner of the country.  Every race, religion, occupation  and background have been represented in the halls of the house.  Only in recent years has the beauty of free expression of ideas and speech been darkened. The resilience of the body through the guidance of the framers will prevail and Representatives like myself will restore truth and transparency  to this honored institution.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Do you believe that it's beneficial for representatives to have previous experience in government or politics?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Yes and No,  I believe a member of the house must have a personal connection to the citizens they serve. Many of the elitist's in office only have a packaged view of their constituents, dictated by polls and staffers.  I ,like my fellow citizens are fast learners. Too much experience in government or politics can jade enthusiasm and stifle fresh thoughts and ideas out of desperation to stay in office.  The house was never meant to be a lifelong appointment. In fact, the Supreme Court is the only institutions the framers intended to be lifelong appointments.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What do you perceive to be the United States’ greatest challenges as a nation over the next decade?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">To maintain our sovereignty against people who refuse to appreciate our great society and the freedom we possess.  We have an obligation to oppose those that would hide our past, good and bad, to control our future.   Carl Sagan said \""You have to know the past to understand the present.\"" I would expand that quote to read \""You have to know the past to understand the present and pave a path to the future.\""</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">If you are not a current representative, are there certain committees that you would want to be a part of?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">The House Committee on Energy and Commerce and The Committee on Education and Labor</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Do you believe that two years is the right term length for representatives?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">yes, it was designed to rotate people and ideas. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What are your thoughts on term limits?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I agree on term limits. I would welcome limits of 3 terms in the House and Senate and prohibit appointments of spouses when a member dies. We are not a monarchy. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">If you are not currently a member of your party’s leadership in the U.S. House of Representatives, would you be interested in joining the leadership? If so, in what role?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I would be interested in a leadership position. I believe in passing the mantle not prying it from someones cold dead hand.  I would have to be in the house and see the actual inner workings of the leadership to determine where I fit in. I also know the cream will always rise to the top.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Is there a particular representative, past or present, whom you want to model yourself after?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Vic Fazio, I opposed his political views but I believe he was sincere in his passion for victims and the local environment.  He was available to his constituents of all political persuasions. I believe he was open to opposing points of view and he had the ability to compromise and reach across the isle. I don't recall him grandstanding to get attention but focused on the work of our community. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Both sitting representatives and candidates for office hear many personal stories from the residents of their district. Is there a story that you’ve heard that you found particularly touching, memorable, or impactful?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">In Truth, my story is my motivation to run for office.  When my representative refused to return my calls, never held town halls and is pretty much unreachable except for photo-ops.  I learned of multiple Federal law suits regarding the contamination of the ground water that services my community. At no time did the water district or my  current House Representative reach out to the community to warn us of the contamination or stand on the House Floor to demand immediate cleanup of the superfund site in the district.  Shortly after the discovery of the extent of the contamination I was diagnosed with Kidney cancer. I was very lucky to have discovered my cancer early . About a third of my right kidney was removed with the tumor and I did not need further treatment.  Since that time I have seen my community in a new light. I notice the number of cancer victims in my neighborhood young and old. Cancer doesn't discriminate based on political party.  I notice the lady around the corner that died of cancer. The elderly couple a few blocks away both battling cancer, the child of a friend who breaks his bones on the playground just trying to be a little boy.  I will never forget the look on the face of my surgeon when I told him about the contamination. His jaw dropped and he lost all expression on his face when he said \""that's my water district\"".</p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">What would be your top three priorities, if elected?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Affordable and accessible healthcare for all (Medicare for All), strengthen our public schools and keep vouchers, charter schools, and homeschooling options out of our rural areas,  upgrade and repair our damaged infrastructure including broadband/create high paying jobs.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What areas of public policy are you personally passionate about?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I am a clinical social worker and addiction counselor.  I am passionate about healthcare for all in my district.  Our hospitals are closing in my district and there are no services to replace them;  this is unacceptable.  We must be able to negotiate the cost of healthcare as well as pharmaceuticals.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Who do you look up to? Whose example would you like to follow, and why?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I had the opportunity to spend the day with Former First Lady Rosalyn Carter at the symposium on mental health at the Carter Center and at our health center.  She has the ability to reach out and connect with people in a very powerful way.  She shook hands with over 1000 people on the day I was with her, and she captured the hearts of all for her ability to connect with all people.  I admire her greatly for all the work she has done and continues to do for mental health.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Is there a book, essay, film, or something else you would recommend to someone who wants to understand your political philosophy?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">""Dave"" and ""Milk"" are the two political films that I connect with. ""Dave"" is  the man who takes the President's place and then wholeheartedly guides the nation.  His lack of experience and his wholesomeness is refreshing.  ""Milk"" is about a man who sacrifices his life because of his belief that everyone should be of value in our country.  Both touch me in different ways but it reminds us that we are all called to a ""higher ground"".</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What characteristics or principles are most important for an elected official?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">An elected official should have the ability to sit down with constituents and listen to what their concerns are and ""what keeps them up at night.""  We need to talk less and listen more to those who are impacted by our policies. A good public servant is doing the job for the people, not to enhance his or her own pockets.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What qualities do you possess that you believe would make you a successful officeholder?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">As a social worker for over thirty years, I am able to listen to people who are experiencing a variety of difficulties; problem solving is something that I do daily with the people that I serve.  I have the perspective of being the vice-chair of a community health center board as well as a domestic violence shelter board.  I work with those of every political persuasion. I am calm and attentive and work with people to bring them together.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What do you believe are the core responsibilities for someone elected to this office?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Listen to constituents and guide policy to meet those needs.  Follow the ""will of the people"" and when I make a decision that is contrary, be available to answer questions and listen to comments. Being accessible to the electorate is vital.  Staying in contact with the leaders of each county is important as well as getting to know as many throughout the 30 county district as possible.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What legacy would you like to leave?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I would like to have served my district by bringing healthcare to all citizens of the district, protecting public education and renewing the status of education in our district, and creating the start of a broad-based infrastructure plan that will help the residents for years to come.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What is the first historical event that happened in your lifetime that you remember? How old were you at the time?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">On November 22, 1963, I was looking forward to my 8th birthday party.  I remember seeing my teachers with tears in their eyes that afternoon.  My mom picked me up from school that day and we went to our church to pray for our country and our president.  I remember watching the funeral procession as a dark mood settled over our country.  We lost our innocence that day and have never gotten it back.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What was your very first job? How long did you have it?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">My first job was giving piano lessons to little kids in the neighborhood.  That lasted a couple of years in high school.  My first real job out of graduate school was working with teens who had dropped out of school.  I worked with them to get their GED's, counseled them on various problems they were experiencing, and worked with them by teaching job skills.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What happened on your most awkward date?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">After seeing the Barbra Streisand version of ""A Star is Born"", a beautiful, heavy snow was on the ground when we got out.  We had no cell phones back then so we were hours late getting home. After battling through the traffic in the snow, we got closer to our homes in the country and found that there was very little snow.  It was a challenge to explain that one to parents!</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What is your favorite holiday? Why?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Christmas.  It is my favorite because I usually take a couple of weeks off work to enjoy decorating and cooking and seeing all family members in one house at the same time!</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What is your favorite book? Why?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">To Kill A Mockingbird-it is a timeless book that tells the story of where we were in American and where we still are struggling.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">If you could be any fictional character, who would you want to be?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">""Scout"" in To Kill a Mockingbird</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What is your favorite thing in your home or apartment? Why?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">We have a tiny three season room that looks out over the woods in our yard.  The room is comfortable, quiet and warm.  Perfect for reading or napping and just looking at the seasons.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What was the last song that got stuck in your head?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">ANYTHING from the musical, ""Alexander Hamilton""</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What is something that has been a struggle in your life?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">My brother died when he was 39.  Our family created the ""village"" that kept his children in a safe space in which to grow. They were 7 and 4 at the time of his death.  They are now successful young adults; one is in medical school and the other just graduated with a degree in hospitality management.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What qualities does the U.S. House of Representatives possess that makes it unique as an institution?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">It is the body that truly represents the real people of the country.  It is the rowdier of the two chambers but it possesses the ability to bring all bills for raising revenue and has the sole power of impeachment.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Do you believe that it's beneficial for representatives to have previous experience in government or politics?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">We need to have representatives that have a variety of experiences, from those who have governmental experience to those who are scientists, teacher, social workers, etc. It takes all walks of life to bring about a well-rounded House.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What do you perceive to be the United States’ greatest challenges as a nation over the next decade?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">We are challenged as a nation to heal the divides that the current inhabitant of the White House continues to produce.  We can only be successful as a nation when we are working together toward solving our problems.  We need people of good faith and truth to be our public servants not the current batch of individuals that seem much more focused on putting money in their own pockets and in those of the millionaires and billionaires.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">If you are not a current representative, are there certain committees that you would want to be a part of?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Ethics, Natural resources, Education and the workforce, veteran affairs</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Do you believe that two years is the right term length for representatives?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">We are wasting money by having elections every two years.  I believe that the terms should be expanded to four years.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What are your thoughts on term limits?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">The more that I see members of Congress who have been in office for decades, the more convinced I am that we need term limits.  We need to decide how we can balance bringing new members in with having those who have been in office for longer periods of time.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What process do you favor for redistricting?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Any process should be transparent, give redistricting authority to those who are not attached to certain elected officials/parties, or be drawn to disenfranchise any group residing in the district.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Is there a particular representative, past or present, whom you want to model yourself after?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">The great dignity of Rep. John Lewis is unsurpassed.  His courage and conviction put most of the rest of us to shame.  I would only hope to have some of his qualities.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Both sitting representatives and candidates for office hear many personal stories from the residents of their district. Is there a story that you’ve heard that you found particularly touching, memorable, or impactful?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I met a young woman invited to a Meet and Greet event for me.  She had never voted before, didn't think she was smart enough.  She shared her story of trying to get custody of her nieces after her sister's opioid  overdose and how hard it was to recover from her husband's loss of work after an injury. I told her that she was the reason that I was running: to help those who need a hand up.  She called me the other day to let me know she got custody of the children and her husband was better.  She said that she had one of my signs in her yard and had registered to vote for the first time.  She just needed a little encouragement.</p>

As I think about how we can get through the chaotic political division that we face, I've found renewed inspiration in the words that President Lincoln spoke on the battlefield of Gettysburg at a time when our nation was more divided than it is today. Of, By &amp; For the People. Our nation has been through a lot, and our resilience is founded in Lincoln's words. His vision can be a blueprint for us -- an anchor -- to help us find common ground and build a government that serves the people.
</p><p><b>OF THE PEOPLE: Serving the American People. Not Corporations</b>
I am making a contract with the people of New Jersey to be the most accessible, transparent, and accountable Member of Congress.   I pledge to always put the people of New Jersey first, and I will fight to make sure that the core unit of our democracy is the citizen, not the dollar sign.
</p><p>➜ Accessible: I will commit to holding at least one in-person town hall every single month.  These will rotate through every township in the district.  I will also have public comments before every vote.
</p><p>➜ Transparent: I will commit to providing daily reports on my work so you know what I am working on and who I am meeting with.
</p><p>➜ Accountable:  I pledge not to accept a dime from corporate PACs because I believe in a government that focuses on people not corporations.  It’s not surprising that my opponent Tom MacArthur raises more money from corporations and special interests than from people. MacArthur showed this when he wrote a health care bill that would have made it harder for us here in New Jersey to get health care, especially those with pre-existing conditions like cancer and heart disease. He showed this when he was the only Member of Congress from New Jersey to vote Yes on a tax bill that gave corporations massive permanent tax cuts while hurting the values of our homes by slashing the property tax deductions that middle-class New Jersey homeowners rely on.
</p><p>Campaign Finance Reform:  Among the very first bills I will seek to introduce in Congress will be to reform the negative influences of money in our politics.  We need to fight against dark money that allows millions of dollars to pour into our elections without requiring disclosures of donors.  We need to find more ways to allow to encourage public financing and other tools so Americans don’t need to be millionaires in order to run.  We also want to explore the use of matching contributions and other steps to empower grassroots supporters and ensure they have a voice.
</p><p>Fight Against Corruption in Washington:  Our leaders should absolutely be held to the highest of standards.  Corruption, harassment of any kind, abuse of power, fraud, and other concerns must not be tolerated.  I will work to put into place strict rules and tough enforcement.
</p><p>End Gerrymandering and Voter Suppression: Voters should choose their politicians instead of politicians choosing their voters.  Elected officials should never be involved in drawing political lines, and all states should have a bipartisan/nonpartisan approach to redistricting.  It is also vital to ensure we work to stop voter suppression. I will do everything I can working with government agencies and grassroots organizations to make that a reality.
</p><p>We can only change Congress by changing the types of people we elect.  Our country is led by people like Tom MacArthur who are out of touch with the struggles that Americans face to pay their bills, provide for their families, and save for retirement.  We must do better.
</p><p><b>BY THE PEOPLE: Standing with American Workers, Veterans, and Retirees</b><br>
Our American Dream is built BY the people, BY American workers.  But we live in a time when fewer than 1 in 5 of us feel like we are living the American Dream.  We can change this.
</p><p>I asked thousands of people across New Jersey to tell me what kept them up at night, and I heard one phrase over and over again — Paycheck to Paycheck. I heard:
</p><p>A young father’s concern that he doesn’t know how he can cover his children’s health care and education costs when he can barely keep up with mortgage payments and utilities.
</p><p>A small group of recent college graduates talk about how their student loan debt was shrinking their opportunities, not expanding them.
</p><p>A woman choke up when she admitted to me that she wasn’t able to save a dime for retirement as she approached the end of her career.
</p><p>This isn’t the American Dream we hoped for.  Three out of four of us who work full-time are living Paycheck to Paycheck, and most are saddled with debt.  There is no wonder that fewer than 1 in 5 Americans feel like they are living the American Dream.
</p><p>When I was a child, my parents explained to me that the American Dream was earning enough to support your family and build a secure future if you do an honest day’s work and play by the rules.  Those that work hard should be able to retire with peace of mind.  We need to get back to this American Dream.  It’s going to take a lot of work, but here are some important ways I want to work with you to get there:
</p><p>Prioritize the American Worker.  When workers win, America wins. As we invest to lead the future, we must remember that the foundation of our economy is the American worker.  As our economy changes, we must provide workers at all levels and ages access to job training to help them get ahead and ensure that they stay competitive. This means supporting unions, project labor agreements, a livable wage, safe work environments, and other critical initiatives that help American workers navigate the uncertainty.  Our workers deserve to thrive, not just survive.
</p><p>Support Small Businesses.  We need a government that is focused on small businesses, unfortunately Tom MacArthur sided with big corporations instead of small business when he strongly supported repealing Net Neutrality.  I will champion legislation to reinstate net neutrality, simplify complicated accounting standards, ease rules that reduce access to capital, and remove other barriers that are making it harder for small businesses to compete with big corporations.
</p><p>End Gender and Workplace Discrimination. The gender pay gap is unfair and must end.  Everyone must get equal pay for equal work. Discrimination and harassment in the workplace are unacceptable.  There needs to be dignity in our work and fairness and equality in our paychecks.
</p><p>Invest in the Industries of the Future.  We won’t have better-paying jobs unless America remains a leader in global innovation and business. But our country is falling behind in key sectors.  Our government’s policies and investments must be focused on ensuring U.S. technology powers the global economy of the future.  We need greater support for STEM education and investments in renewable energy, high-tech manufacturing, biotech, and other fast-growing sectors. Perhaps nowhere in the country is better suited for this type of high tech growth than New Jersey.
</p><p>Support Veterans. Veterans have served our country and we must do everything we can to help them succeed. That means ensuring a strong and efficient VA and recognizing their military credentials in the civilian workforce. There are no more reliable and trustworthy worker than our veterans.
</p><p>Fix Our Taxes by Creating Permanent Tax Cuts for Middle Class Families Instead of Corporations.  I will work from Day One to get a tax reform that will focus on permanent cuts for the middle class.  Tom MacArthur was the only Member of Congress from NJ to vote YES on a tax bill that gave permanent tax cuts to corporations while creating temporary tax relief to Americans that will expire in a few years.  Because MacArthur supported restrictions on State and Local Tax deductions, New Jersey home values are estimated to drop by 7.5 percent.  Meanwhile, Tom MacArthur supported giving wealthy Americans like himself a $22.5 million tax exemption on their estates.  Saddling our nation and future generations with over a trillion dollars to pay for tax breaks that overwhelming go to corporations and the wealthiest Americans is unfair and must be fixed.
</p><p>Rebuild American Infrastructure.  We can rebuild America and create a new generation of jobs if we make the right investments.  Our economy won’t succeed without the right infrastructure. Roads, bridges, tunnels, power grids, and ports across New Jersey and the country are crumbling and need to be rebuilt and maintained in a smart way. We must also invest in our technology infrastructure to make sure that every community has affordable access to the high speed internet connection that is vital to growing local economies.
</p><p>Getting You the Education to Stay Competitive.  This means investing in teachers, schools and students; making college more affordable so we don’t saddle our next generation with enormous debt; and supporting trade schools and apprenticeships.
</p><p>Helping You Retire with Peace of Mind
</p><p>My mother is retiring this year and she has many sleepless nights worrying about how she will cover her bills.  She, like many others, will depend on Social Security for nearly all of her income.  She will depend on Medicare for her healthcare.  Now Paul Ryan is saying “We’re going to have to get back next year at entitlement reform, which is how you tackle the debt and the deficit.” Americans need more support and security, not Congress uprooting years of careful financial planning at the last minute to help finance a tax cut for millionaires and corporations.
</p><p>➜ Stop Tom MacArthur’s “Age Tax.”  AARP strongly condemned MacArthur for his health care amendment that would have allowed “insurance companies to charge older Americans and people with preexisting health conditions higher premiums and weaken critical consumer protections…The MacArthur amendment, simply put, makes a bad bill even worse.” 
</p><p>➜ Protect and Expand Social Security.  A third of elderly Americans rely on Social Security for all of their income.  We need to ensure that they get what they need and explore ways to provide additional security.
</p><p>➜ Expand Retirement Accounts.  Nearly half of all private sector employees in America, 55 million workers, don’t have a retirement savings plan through their employers.  Let’s create more options to make retirement saving possible for these workers as well as people that are self-employed, caregivers, and others that do not currently have access to a 401k or pension program.  Everyone should have an easy way to save for retirement.
</p><p>➜ Lower Prescription Drug Costs for Medicare.  On fixed incomes, rising drug costs are a major threat to security.  We must find ways to keep costs down by allowing Medicare to negotiate prices for drugs and medical equipment and by requiring price justifications by pharmaceutical companies.
</p><p>➜ Support Community Living and Caregivers.  Our elderly deserve to live with dignity and security.  Let’s work together to ensure that they have the access, mobility, and support they need to thrive in vibrant communities.
</p><p><b>FOR THE PEOPLE: Supporting and Protecting the American Family</b><br>
My wife and two trouble-making baby boys are my world.  I am running for Congress to protect our families and give us every opportunity to provide strong and stable futures for our children.
</p><p>Lowering Your Health Care and Prescription Drug Costs
</p><p>Millions of Americans who live Paycheck to Paycheck are one accident or sickness away from disaster.  My father suffered from polio as a child and my mother is a nurse who has served New Jersey residents for decades.  They raised me to believe that staying healthy is essential to achieving the American Dream, and that no one in the richest, most powerful country in the world should die or go bankrupt because they can’t afford to go to a doctor.  Our current system has expanded coverage to millions of Americans, but it still falls far short and costs keep rising. We need a better way forward that provides affordable and accessible health care for all of us. Here is a good place to start:
</p><p>Lower Prescription Drug Costs.  The concern I’ve heard about the most while talking to people across New Jersey is the high price of prescription drugs.  It is unacceptable that so many people are unable to afford the medications they need, and this needs to be addressed immediately.  Congress must prioritize steps to reduce drug prices including allowing Medicare to directly negotiate lower prices with pharmaceutical companies, requiring pricing transparency, and implementing safeguards against price gouging.
</p><p>Get Everyone Covered. Our country, our economy, our security will be stronger when our people are healthier.  Having millions of people without health insurance raises the costs for all of us.  We need to ensure everyone, rich or poor, has access to quality affordable healthcare.  This is our new moonshot, and we can save countless lives in the process.
</p><p>Invest in Doctors, Nurses, and other Medical Professionals. A doctor in Toms River told me that we need health care that focuses on people instead of profits.  I couldn’t agree more.  Every medical professional I talk to is focused on improving care for patients.  We need to help train a new generation of professionals to ensure an adequate workforce.  We also need reforms that transform the industry to reflect these providers’ values that prioritize patient care, not just treating problems.
</p><p>Permanently Fund Children’s Health Insurance Plan (CHIP).  CHIP is part of our promise to our children and playing politics with their health is embarrassing and disrespectful. Let’s never let CHIP expire again or worry about whether a child can get the care they need for a bright future.
</p><p>Protect People with Pre-Existing Conditions. Tom MacArthur single-handedly revived TrumpCare by authoring legislation that would have made it harder for people with cancer, heart disease, and other pre-existing conditions to get the care they need.  I will never vote for any legislation that makes it harder for those that need the care the most to get it.
</p><p>Expand Veteran Care. A veteran should never have to travel far to find care or wait too long to receive treatment.  I owe my life to the armed servicemen and women who kept me safe in Afghanistan.  I will always stand by them.
</p><p>Support Community Health Centers, especially in Rural Areas. Community health centers are key assets in our communities and they need funding and support to provide vital healthcare services, especially in underserved areas such as rural communities.
</p><p><br>
Protecting Our Families and Communities From Crises
</p><p>➜ Protect Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst.  I will never take our Joint Base for granted.  We all know how quickly the future of bases can change.  I’m committed to protecting and supporting the Joint Base and will seek to serve on the House Armed Services Committee.  As a former adviser to Generals Petraeus and John Allen in Afghanistan and as a former Pentagon official, I will be a strong champion for the base, our armed service men and women, and our veterans.
</p><p>➜ End Veteran Homelessness and Increase Health Support.  With tens of thousands of veterans in our district, we need to expand veteran services, especially access to VA health facilities and programs.  I will also prioritize efforts to make sure no veteran in New Jersey or across the country has to sleep on the streets.  The words “veteran” and “homeless” should never appear in the same sentence.
</p><p>➜ Protect Against National Security Threats.  My children are growing up in a world more dangerous than the one I grew up in.  The threat of nuclear weapons has returned, and instability and conflict affect every corner of the globe.  As a career public servant and national security expert, I will be a champion in Congress for a strong, responsible, and strategic national security operation that focuses on defense, but also diplomacy and development.  
</p><p>➜ Recover from Superstorm Sandy and Prepare for the Next One.  Too many people are still struggling to recover after Sandy.  After what we saw in Houston, Florida, and Puerto Rico, we know it is only a matter of time before we get hit again. We are not ready.  We need help people in New Jersey to mitigate risks by raising the height of homes and protecting our communities, stop Tom MacArthur from making changes to the National Flood Insurance Plan that would gut spending for flood maps and be a boon for the same private insurance companies that underpaid Sandy families and allow them to cherry pick who they cover.
</p><p>➜ Stop Offshore Drilling.  The Trump Administration’s recent decision to open New Jersey’s coast to offshore drilling is a threat to our way of life.  Our beautiful shores, our home values, our recreational and commercial fishing industries, and our local businesses are in dire risk.  I will relentlessly fight back against these threats with no compromise.
</p><p>➜ Treat the Opioid Epidemic as a National Security Crisis.  Our leaders in Washington aren’t doing enough to address the devastation of opioids.  142 Americans die every day.  This is a national security crisis that takes more lives than any war or conflict that we are engaged in, but President Trump and Tom MacArthur aren’t treating it with the seriousness it needs.  We need a real national strategy and full funding to stem the tide.
</p><p>➜ Respond to Climate Change as a National Security Crisis.  If President Trump, Tom MacArthur, and Scott Pruitt won’t lead on protecting us from the dangers of climate change, I will.  Exiting the Paris Climate Agreement and gutting the Environmental Protection Agency are hurting all of us.  I will push to enact legislation and take actions to once again give us clean air to breathe and clean water to drink and work to protect our shores from rising seas.

				<p class=""survey-question"">What would be your top three priorities, if elected?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Social Justice (Women's reproductive rights, ending mass incarceration, care of veterans, commonsense gun reform)
Economic Justice (Workers' right to organize, Paycheck Fairness, rewriting bankruptcy laws to place workers pay and benefits first)
Rebuilding Appalachia and other coal extraction communities.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What areas of public policy are you personally passionate about?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Veterans' issues: We can never break the social contract we have to care for those who've served.
Women's reproductive rights: Roe v. Wade was decided correctly almost five decades ago. Period.
Foreign relations: Talking is better than shooting. A robust, professional State Department forestalls paying the butcher's bill.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Who do you look up to? Whose example would you like to follow, and why?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I look up most to the Marine who commanded my battalion in Mogadishu 92-93. Kind of a pre-Mattis, Mattis. He came in peace but was more than happy to shoot at bad guys if that's what they wanted.
He entrusted us junior Marines to do our jobs without supervision, kicked us in the butt when we needed it, but always backed us up if we made a mistake while trying to do the right thing. Funnily, he has said he can't back me because of my progressive positions. On the other hand, when I told him I was running, he said, ""Mike, you are and will always be my Ishmael."" So I've got that going for me.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Is there a book, essay, film, or something else you would recommend to someone who wants to understand your political philosophy?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">""War is a racket,"" by Smedley D. Butler. In which a legendary, highly-decorated Marine general realizes he spent a lot of his career killing people for American fruit companies. 
Also, later in his life, Butler was approached by American fascists to participate in a coup against FDR and he called the FBI.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">

Moral courage.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What do you believe are the core responsibilities for someone elected to this office?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Leading. An elected official will never be in agreement with all of his or her constituents but taking bold and aggressive positions that benefit them and are in the best interest of the nation will never be in the wrong.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What legacy would you like to leave?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">""Here lie the mortal remains of the man who saved the Republic by ridding the nation of Mitch McConnell.""</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What is the first historical event that happened in your lifetime that you remember? How old were you at the time?</p>

			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What was your very first job? How long did you have it?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I started changing car and truck tires at 15-years old and kept that job for 2-years. I asked for a day off because I needed to take my driver's test when I turned 16. My boss, who had me driving our snowplow and wrecker for a year, asked, ""How the hell old are you???""</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What happened on your most awkward date?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Slowly realized that my date was married and had to extricate myself.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What is your favorite holiday? Why?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Summer Solstice. By June 21 we've been picking asparagus for three or four hours a day since late March. There is nothing agriculturally significant about this date, just one were we are about exhausted from the effort.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What is your favorite book? Why?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">A Confederacy of Dunces most recently, but I have quite a few favorites.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">If you could be any fictional character, who would you want to be?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Huck Finn. He decided he'd rather go to hell than return his friend to slavery.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What is your favorite thing in your home or apartment? Why?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Not really big on ""things,"" but I like the antique religious icons, totems and statues we've collected during our travels the world over. If I had to pick one, it's a menorah from Morocco that dates back to sometime after the Inquisition when Jews were welcomed there.</p>

			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What is something that has been a struggle in your life?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I struggled rejecting my family's conservative religious and political views as I became less sure that they were: a)correct, and b)objective. It's hard to part from ""family values"" and I am saddened that my growth has distanced me from my kin.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What qualities does the U.S. Senate possess that makes it unique as an institution?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Historically speaking, I admire the Senate's conduct that earned it the title ""world's most deliberative body"" but the artificial comity and hail-fellow-well-met behavior on the floor today is a thin veneer. The days of the deep thinkers and those who routinely and significantly worked across the aisle are probably long gone.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Do you believe that it’s beneficial for senators to have previous experience in government or politics?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">No.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What do you think of the filibuster?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I think the weaponized filibuster has exposed a fundamental flaw in our system of government that allows a single person to defy the will of the nation.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What criteria would you apply when deciding whether to confirm presidential appointees?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I don't care about a person's religious beliefs, personal beliefs or origin story. I want to know what they know about the subject and how they will act when faced with challenges. Regarding judges, my firm rule is that I will not appoint anyone to a federal bench who does not agree that Roe v. Wade was properly decided almost 5 decades ago and is the law of the land.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What do you perceive to be the United States’ greatest challenges as a nation over the next decade?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Repairing our alliances with allies shoved aside and belittled by the current administration and reentering civil international discourse to address military, economic and environmental challenges.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Do you believe it’s beneficial to build relationships with other senators?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Absolutely. Regardless of party. Appalachia coal country will only be fully repaired and fairly compensated if representatives from Kentucky, Ohio, Pennsylvania, West Virginia Alabama, Maryland and Tennessee are pulling in the same direction.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">If you are not a current senator, are there certain committees that you would want to be a part of?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Veterans' Affairs, Rural Development and Energy, State Department and USAID Management.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">If you are not currently a member of your party’s leadership in the U.S. Senate, would you be interested in joining the leadership? If so, in what role?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I'd love to work with Senator Sanders on Outreach. Energizing the next generation of progressive voters by soliciting their priorities and working them into the legislative agenda so they feel a part of the party that wants to represent them.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Is there a particular senator, past or present, whom you want to model yourself after?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Maybe Mike Mansfield. He labored in mines, served in the Great War, changed his mind about early support for the Vietnam War and skillfully attained Republican support for the Civil Rights Act. Despite some of his flaws, I believe he always had the best interest of the nation at heart and was willing to support bipartisan action when deserved.</p>

				<p class=""survey-response"">FORD O'CONNELL is a businessman, lawyer, and conservative media advocate from Naples, Florida, who currently serves as a Trump White House and campaign surrogate for the 2020 election.

He is a respected media analyst and frequent guest on Fox News, Fox Business and other broadcast media. Ford's political analysis and commentary have appeared in a variety of publications including The Wall Street Journal, the New York Post, and ESPN.com. 
 
A graduate of the University of Virginia School of Law, Mr. O'Connell graduated from Swarthmore College with a B.A. in Political Science and Religion. Ford also obtained a MPP from Duke University, and a M.S. in Journalism from Northwestern University.

Ford O'Connell, a former Heritage Foundation intern, has been actively supporting conservative candidates and campaigns since 2007, when he first worked with the Haley Barbour 2007 gubernatorial campaign.

				<p class=""survey-response"">My grandfather, Henry Salvatori. He was an Italian immigrant to this country who believed strongly in the American Dream, the tenants of citizenship and conservative values. He built a successful petroleum company and went on to become an advisor to three U.S. Presidents: Nixon, Reagan and Bush 41.

					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What qualities do you possess that you believe would make you a successful officeholder?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">A drive to serve my community. 

My experience. My background in the media, appearing regularly on Fox News, Fox Business and other news outlets for years made me an adept communicator who is able to get my message through and across, which will make me a more successful advocate for the FL-19 constituents. The time I spent in Washington as a surrogate for President Trump gave me enough knowledge about the way things work to know how to effectively get things done. I won't need training wheels and will hit the ground running to start accomplishing things on day one.

The fact I'm not beholden to special interests. I'm not a career politician.

Term limits are essential for our nation and should be implemented through any means necessary including calling for an Article V Convention. Career politicians do a disservice to America. Serving in government was never meant to be a profession; it was meant to be public service on behalf of the constituents.

			</div>
							<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What areas of public policy are you personally passionate about?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Partisan politics led by many politicians in Washington has caused our government process to ignore the general interests of Americans as a whole thus divide rather than unite us. I am passionate about getting back to where the interests of ALL Americans comes before the interest of special interest groups or those who shout the loudest. Phillip Kline, a professor at Liberty University School of Law, wrote, ""Government is formed not to create special privileges, not to listen to the loudest voice, not to pay attention to those who write the biggest checks: rather our government was formed to recognize our intrinsic value by protecting our inherent rights [for all Americans]."" I want to champion Iowa and America in the same way I have done for my clients in business in the private sector for 35 years.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Who do you look up to? Whose example would you like to follow, and why?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I always looked up to my father, a WWII Navy veteran, and a man of his word. In business, he always put his clients before himself. I also admire former President Ronald Reagan. He was known as ""The Great Communicator."" He was a man who believed in God and loved America. He warned about the dangers if government is allowed to grow too large, ""Government does not solve problems; it subsidizes them.""</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Is there a book, essay, film, or something else you would recommend to someone who wants to understand your political philosophy?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I appreciate American History and American political philosophy books. The following are excellent reads:
Conservative Heart: How to Build a Fairer, Happier, and More Prosperous America by Arthur C. Brooks
Our Lost Declaration by Senator Mike Lee
The Case Against Socialism by Senator Rand Paul
John Adams by David McCullough</p>

				<p class=""survey-response"">A legacy where America remains free and prosperous, and uniting our communities more than ever before.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What is the first historical event that happened in your lifetime that you remember? How old were you at the time?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Growing up I lived next door to a Cattle Commissioner that represented farmers and ranchers in Iowa and Nebraska. On Saturday mornings he would hire me and my next door neighbor to come down to the Omaha Stockyards with him. We were about 12 to 14 years old at the time. He would represent the farmers and ranchers selling their livestock to the Omaha packing plants. Omaha overtook Chicago as the nation's largest livestock market and meat packing industry center in 1955, a title which it held onto until 1971. The 116-year-old institution closed in 1999. After negotiating the sale of the cattle we would have to move the cattle through the chutes to various pens in the stockyards. Working those days at the nation's largest livestock market I will remember forever.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What was your very first job? How long did you have it?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">At fourteen years old, I had a daily newspaper route. It required ordering and paying for the newspapers, picking them up at a neighborhood drop site, delivering, and collecting payment from each subscriber on my route. I held this job for two years. As soon as I turned 16, I got a job at our local Hinky Dinky grocery store after school and on weekends. I worked my way up to checker (cashier) and stocking store shelves. I had this job for two years.</p>

					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What is your favorite book? Why?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I love the Bible.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What qualities does the U.S. House of Representatives possess that makes it unique as an institution?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">The U.S. House of Representatives brings forth concerns, ideas, and solutions from constituents via its Congressional leaders to improve the lives of Americans in the 50 states. The House is part of a greater checks and balances that exists in our government to maintain liberties and dignities remain in the hands of its people.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Do you believe that it's beneficial for representatives to have previous experience in government or politics?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">The original idea of our Founding Fathers was for the states to send representative(s) to Washington that had experience from their communities and businesses. Connecticut Delegate and a Founding Father, Roger Sherman, spoke of the necessity of regular elections during the Convention, ""Representatives ought to return home and mix with the people. By remaining at the seat of Govt. they would acquire the habits of the place which might differ from those of their Constituents."" It was said that persons could leave their farms or jobs to serve their country for two years then return home.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What do you perceive to be the United States’ greatest challenges as a nation over the next decade?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Over the next decade, Congress and The White House must get the United States fiscal house in order. Running a one trillion dollar deficit every year on top of the twenty trillion dollar existing deficit is unsustainable. Our failure to do so puts a tremendous burden on all Americans. 
Another challenge is the dangerous notion that purports socialism is a good idea. Anyone who has lived under socialism will tell you what it is like in reality. American ingenuity and free markets have allowed for greater prosperity and economic success for more of its citizens than anywhere else in the world. Winston Churchill called socialism, ""the philosophy of failure and the equal sharing of misery."" More people need to read primary documents from history.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">If you are not a current representative, are there certain committees that you would want to be a part of?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">The Appropriations Committee because they are the ones that designate government spending. The Agriculture Committee because it is a vital industry in the Fourth District of Iowa.

				<p class=""survey-question"">Who are you? Tell us about yourself in 300 words or less.</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I am a lifelong San Diegan, not a career politician. Our District needs energetic and focused leadership; Congress has lost touch with our needs. 

I have been married 33 years and a loving Father. I have grown businesses, created jobs for hundreds of San Diegans, and raised over $100 million for companies in the 52nd District. I'm a technology innovator, awarded five patents, and the co-inventor of mobile check deposit used by 80 million Americans. I'm an advocate for equal opportunity. Early in my career, I helped implement social welfare policies for the County of San Diego and joined USDA's Food and Nutrition Service to fight national food insecurity.

As CEO of Mitek Systems headquartered in the 52nd District, I led it to become a global provider of identity verification and payments solutions to protect consumers. I was a Rotary Scholar in Singapore and lived and worked in China where I became an expert on foreign trade and US China relations.

I'm a passionate American, and believe we need innovative, immediate action to solve our problems, including immigration, homelessness and border sewage destroying our beaches. I support a clean environment and climate action, and will fight to balance our budget.
</p>
			</div>
						    <div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Please list below 3 key messages of your campaign. What are the main points you want voters to remember about your goals for your time in office?</p>
				<ul class=""key-messages"">
					<li>I am a lifelong San Diegan and not a career politician. I am a resident of the 52nd District who has achieved real results for millions of people. As a technology entrepreneur who co-invented mobile check deposit used by 80 million Americans, I have created jobs for hundreds of San Diegans through innovation and common sense and will do the same as your Representative in Congress. </li>
					<li>Congress has lost touch with your voice. My opponent has failed to pass a single bill he sponsored in 8 years while voting the harmful Pelosi/AOC agenda 95%. When elected, I will listen and act to benefit every family throughout the 52nd District.</li>
					<li>The 52nd represents over half of San Diego's economy. I have successfully worked in government and business, and have the technology expertise to represent our technology district. We need innovative, immediate action to solve urgent problems including illegal immigration, homelessness and border sewage destroying our beaches. Our safety is being violated every day by cyber-criminals and predators hacking into homes and hospitals. I am running because Congress lacks the focus and technology knowledge to solve these problems.</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
							<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What areas of public policy are you personally passionate about?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I'm passionate about solving homelessness and the Tijuana river sewage problem destroying our environment. I know that with American ingenuity, we can achieve 100% renewable and clean energy with the right incentives and partnerships that won't destroy our economy. I have confidence in technology and the market economy to reverse high healthcare costs and make it accessible to all. 

America wins through competition and streamlined government oversight. This is also true for health insurance. Government-run healthcare will skyrocket costs and reduce services. We must foster interstate competition to lower costs, rather than limiting insurance options.
 
The 52nd District is home to the world's leading research, desalination, energy, and scientific minds.  Yet our District is invisible nationally and we lack an effective voice in Congress regarding technical innovation. My opponent: 0 bills in 8 years.  I've driven successful innovation throughout my career.

It's inexcusable that we tolerate human waste, needles and encampments on our streets. Our District and region lead the world in medical innovation. Congress should leverage this and re-build our mental health infrastructure and drug treatment programs, rather than passing the buck to a patchwork of local efforts.
It's inexcusable that Tijuana River sewage closed our beaches for 500 days over the past three years. Our Congress needs to act, and act now. The recent USMCA allocation for sewage treatment is inadequate</p>

					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Who do you look up to? Whose example would you like to follow, and why?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Clay Christensen is a renown professor and remembered as a giant of business, faith and wisdom. He was the groundbreaking author of \""The Innovator's Dilemma,\"" but more importantly authored \""How Will You Measure Your Life\"" featuring fidelity to your family and the principles of helping others achieve their dreams.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What characteristics or principles are most important for an elected official?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Integrity, honesty and transparency. Tell the truth, value the voice of the people and their tax dollars. Take a stand and Focus, focus, focus. Too many politicians stay below the radar and cater to too many special interests.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What qualities do you possess that you believe would make you a successful officeholder?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Honest, hard working, creative, effective at building consensus and delivering results. Willing to take a stand and fight hard.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What legacy would you like to leave?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">A better, more unified America, one which values our institutions of democracy and our unique exceptionalism in the world. We are a great country.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What is the first historical event that happened in your lifetime that you remember? How old were you at the time?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">As a elementary school student, I remember the assassinations of John Kennedy, Bobby Kennedy and Martin Luther King. It instilled in me that freedom is never free, and that heroes like these inspire me and a better America.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What qualities does the U.S. House of Representatives possess that makes it unique as an institution?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">The House has a unique opportunity to reflect the Voice of the People. Regrettably, the current House is divided and encumbered by partisan bickering, wasteful use of time and the people's tax money. Congress has lost touch with the people. This is why I am running with the campaign message of \""Your Voice. Your Vote.\""</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Do you believe that it's beneficial for representatives to have previous experience in government or politics?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">It is beneficial to be involved in our communities, governing bodies and business. The combination provides a unique and fresh perspective to understanding How the Economy Works, The Value of the Tax Dollar, and Creative Ways to Address our most pressing problems practically. Politics should not be a career, inherently conflicted over maintaining public office, rather than objective solutions in the interest of the People that may go against special interests. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What do you perceive to be the United States’ greatest challenges as a nation over the next decade?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">The greatest challenge to the United States is to unify our efforts with practical solutions to solve our most pressing problems. We must have confidence in our exceptional form of democratic government that is uniquely designed for the people and by the people, and not be persuaded by the false promise of socialist policies that undermine our liberties and centralize power in government.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">If you are not a current representative, are there certain committees that you would want to be a part of?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Ways and Means, Science and Technology. These represent the future of what we spend and how we spend taxpayer resources.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Do you believe that two years is the right term length for representatives?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Yes. Keep it fresh. However, the political money and power of incumbency undermines a true representative government. We need more scientists, doctors, businessmen, and other career professionals,  rather than long term politicians who have lost touch.</p>

America is the leader of the free world, and should not back down from this responsibility. We can never forget the atrocities of September 11th, and what occurs when you allow terrorists to operate freely in ungoverned areas. We must continue to take the fight to ISIS, not only in Syria and Iraq, but also in Afghanistan and Africa. The threat of radical Islam is real, and we must do a better job fighting on all fronts. I have been doing that for my entire adult life.
</p><p>We also cannot forget the threat right across the border: the Mexican drug cartels. In many areas right across the border, the Mexican government has no control whatsoever. We need to do a better job working with the Mexican authorities to thwart this threat, and prevent weapons and drug trafficking across the border, in both directions. This threat has been largely forgotten by American politicians. That must change.
</p><p>Russia continues to test our will and our NATO allies. Vladimir Putin operates as a dictator, unaccountable to his own people. This allows him complete freedom to disrupt American interests and attack our country. A strong stance must be taken against Russian active measures, while also cooperating in areas of mutual interest. Putin understands realpolitik and political warfare, and we must too.
</p><p>North Korea cannot be tolerated as a belligerent rogue regime for much longer. We must stand behind the president as he builds a coalition against North Korea. However, we should be exceptionally wary of pre-emptive action against North Korea. The consequences could be catastrophic for both American service-members and the South Koreans. No one knows the costs of war better than I do.
</p><p>We need to follow the president’s lead in rebuilding the U.S. military. I have seen first-hand the toll that 16 years of warfare has taken on our soldiers, sailors, and airmen. Our ships are barely operational and the ones that are deployed are colliding and running aground. We need policy changes, and strong leadership to set us back on the right course. We need better cyber defenses, and we need to do better at keeping talented people in the military. We need to invest in new technology to maintain our edge, as China and Russia quickly catch up.
</p><p><br>
<b>Economy</b>
Fundamental tax reform is long overdue. As the debate in Congress rages on and Democrats make false accusations about Republican ideas, we must stick to free-market principles. We must lower the corporate rate while also removing unnecessary special-interest deductions. We have to give corporations the incentives to repatriate their profits so we can grow our tax base, and encourage investments in THIS country. Corporations are not evil, they create jobs, employ Americans, and grow our economy. We must simplify the individual income tax, and remove deductions that distort our economy and reduce revenue unnecessarily. We must stand for pro-growth policies, because we cannot lift the poor out of poverty or raise middle class wages without a strong and growing economy. This is common sense economics, and we must show leadership to make it happen.
</p><p>We must embrace free trade, and seek to give our businesses advantages by reducing regulatory burdens and lowering corporate tax rates. Small businesses are the primary driver of growth in this country and we need to ensure their success. It should be easy for entrepreneurs to start up their business and contribute to our strong economy. We have to protect the business owners that cannot afford to pay teams of lawyers to comply with tax law and regulations.
</p><p>Social Security is on its way to complete collapse, and no one is talking about it. The CBO projects the Social Security OASDI trust fund to become insolvent by 2029. Without more revenue, benefits will be cut by approximately 29% in 2029. Until recently, the trust fund balance was growing steadily. But as the population continues aging and the ratio of workers to retirees decreases, the trust fund will eventually be depleted. It is vital to implement a solution that does not unexpectedly cut seniors’ benefits, but also does not place an unnecessary tax burden on today’s workers.
</p><p>We must gradually transition to a mixed pay-as-you-go and investment-based system. Current workers will contribute an additional percentage of their taxable income into a personal retirement account (PRA) invested in a limited number of approved investment funds, which offer higher growth. These contributions should be small enough so as not to invite unnecessary risk, but large enough so that future retirement benefits can be maintained without greatly increasing the payroll tax.
</p><p>Our national debt has doubled in the past ten years. We cannot keep borrowing from our children. We can’t just cut discretionary spending, we have to attack the hard stuff: mandatory spending to include Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. If our debt continues to increase, we face increased interest rates that will reduce investment and become a drag on economic growth. We will be less flexible if we need to inject a trillion tax dollars into the economy, as we did during the financial crisis of 2008. Our credit will eventually suffer, and foreign investors will be less likely to buy up our debt, causing the U.S. dollar to collapse. It’s time we started making common sense decisions about spending before it is too late.
</p><p><br>
<b>2nd Amendment</b>
I will always fight for 2nd Amendment rights. Democrats who don’t understand how guns even work continue to propose frivolous and ineffective gun-control legislation in Congress. We cannot allow the Leftists to set the terms of the gun rights debate in this country.  Many states have borderline unconstitutional gun laws. We cannot allow this to happen in Texas. We must do a better job of enforcing current laws, especially background checks, so that guns stay out of the wrong hands. But I will never allow the government to prevent law-abiding citizens from defending themselves.
</p><p><br>
<b>Abortion</b>
As a country, we must place more value on LIFE. I believe that each life is created by God for a special, unique purpose, and that every life has inherent value. Being pro-life goes beyond politics. It is a foundational, moral position on the side of humanity.
</p><p>We must stop late-term abortions in this country. I believe our country is on very shaky moral ground by allowing the abortion of a human being with ten fingers, ten toes, and heartbeat. This is not an attack on women, it is a question of our humanity. Not even far-left European countries like France allow abortions past 12 weeks, and yet we do?
</p><p><br>
<b>Immigration</b>
Border security, border security, border security. Border security must come first, before we have any other conversation. Enough is enough, let’s enforce our laws. We should not only build the wall but also ramp up tech-savvy ways to secure our border, like drones and sensors. My background in national security makes me uniquely qualified to assess different proposals and find the right solution.
</p><p>Furthermore, border security leads to better legal immigration laws. When we finally secure the border – a proposal that used to be bipartisan – we can then talk about next steps for immigration reform. America is still the shining city on the hill and we need good, legal immigrants with skills, a hard work ethic, and conservative values to come into this country. But they should do it legally, and we should welcome them. We should move to a merit based immigration system, so that we get the best of the best in our country.
</p><p>Sanctuary cities are an affront to our law enforcement and national security. When illegal immigrants commit crimes, we should enforce both criminal law AND immigration law. Encouraging law enforcement agencies to cooperate with one another is common sense, and good policy.
</p><p><br>
<b>Religious Liberty</b>
I will never let the government force a private citizen or business to actively participate in an activity that directly violates their religious beliefs. Period. We are simply protecting the freedom of individuals to abstain from something that violates their religious beliefs. This is common sense.
</p><p>The original Americans who came over from Europe and founded this country came here for religious and economic liberty. They were people of conscience who wanted to be able to worship freely, build their communities, work hard, and live their lives free of unwarranted government intrusion into their lives. Religious liberty and pluralism have always been bedrock principles of the American republic, and I will fight every day in Congress to preserve this legacy. 
</p><p><br>
<b>Education</b>
Our education system is not preparing our students for the future or for the current work force. We have to encourage competition and dynamism in our schools. I believe in school choice policies, and putting the student first. We should allow families to choose the school that works best for their student: whether it be traditional public schools, public charter schools, virtual schools, private schools, or home schooling. School choice is about freedom, competition, and improving education for all children.  
</p><p>We also need to encourage policies that professionalize our teacher workforce. Study after study shows that the primary driver of good educational outcomes is good teachers. Not new iPads, or fancy stadiums, but good teachers. We need to focus on the basics. Our teachers are true patriots, and our hard-earned tax dollars should go towards improving teacher quality and rewarding good teachers, not endless federal bureaucracy in the Department of Education.
</p><p>College is becoming too expensive for working class families, and not giving students the skills they need to succeed. Government subsidies have caused education costs to sky rocket, and it is only getting more expensive. A 4-year degree is the right choice for a lot of people, but it should not be the only choice. We need to encourage vocational training and apprenticeship programs that give workers the skills that industries actually need.
</p><p>There are an estimated 5-7 million job openings in medium-skilled sectors that are not being filled, because we do not have the workers with the right skills. They don’t need English majors, they need technicians, data analysts, and manufacturing specialists. These skills are obtained through on-the-job training, apprenticeships, and trade schools. We need to start those paths in high school, and make it easier for laid off workers to obtain those skills when looking for new work.
</p><p><br>
<b>Federalism &amp; the 10th Amendment</b>
I am a strong advocate for the idea of federalism, and the wisdom of the 10th amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Political power should be taken out of Washington and sent back to state capitals and local communities. I believe that policy is best made at the local level, where voters can reach out and touch their representatives. This is common sense policy, because different regions and communities face different challenges and preferences.
</p><p>One-size-fits-all policies are counter to our Founding Fathers’ vision of the Republic, and we need to adhere to the greatest legal document in the world: the U.S. Constitution. Federal overreach causes inefficient and confusing policy, and it allows unelected bureaucrats to create de facto laws and regulations. As your congressman, I will fight to restore federalism and the 10th amendment.
</p><p><br>
<b>Free Speech</b>
Our country is frighteningly close to violating our Constitution by allowing the left to shout down and shame anyone who disagrees with them. This is happening regularly on college campuses all over the country. From Berkeley to Boston, leftist agitators are trying to “enforce” political correctness by shutting down speeches that they disagree with. Even some liberal commentators are finding this problematic and have called them out for their anti-American ways. College should be a place for the free and open exchange of ideas, not a place where groupthink and political correctness are enforced, and anti-conservative thugs reign supreme.
</p><p>We need to encourage and inspire young conservatives to stand up to this leftist bullying. I do not back down from fights, and I am not about to back down from this one. The future of our country is at stake.
</p><p><br>
<b>Healthcare</b>
We need a free market, patient-centered health care system. Unfortunately, ObamaCare was a massive government takeover of the health care system, and it has been an unmitigated disaster. Congress needs to immediately repeal this horrible law, and the president needs to sign it. ObamaCare has caused health care costs to go up, has kicked millions of Americans off of their health insurance plans, and has increased taxes, all of which have been detrimental to the health care system.
</p><p>We need to replace it with a health care system that puts patients first, encourages competition, allows consumers to buy health insurance across state lines, and expands health savings accounts.
</p><p>I understand all too well the experience of being a patient in socialized medicine, both in the military and the VA. When no one is held accountable, and there’s no competition, quality of care suffers and prices skyrocket.  We must give states the flexibility to experiment with solutions that deliver the cheapest and highest quality care to the most people. As Americans, we should all agree on this common-sense goal.
</p><p>We have to look at the insurance market differently. When we force insurance to cover routine visits or treatments, the costs of those treatments naturally skyrocket and premiums follow suit. The employer-based health insurance deduction lowers wages and hides the actual costs of healthcare. As a result, health care is overused without any measurable improvement in health outcomes.
</p><p>Medicaid continues to grow without actually improving Americans’ health. When Medicaid enrollees increase drastically, as they did under Obamacare, we reduce the quality of care for our poorest and neediest patients. We need to block grant Medicaid payments to states so they can experiment effectively. I have faith that Texas will use that money effectively and efficiently, and ensure that the neediest Texans get the health care they need.  The federal government may mean well, but it isn’t doing well.
</p><p>It is time for Congress to take on out-of-control drug prices, and beat back the pharmaceutical lobby. We must change the incentives for hospitals, doctors, and pharmaceutical companies so that free market forces can effectively reduce drug prices. We need more transparency in research and development costs, and we need the FDA to assess the effectiveness of new drugs compared to existing drugs, so that consumers are not tricked into buying more expensive, but less effective medicine. We need to allow Medicare to negotiate drug prices and establish common formularies, much like the VA does. This encourages free market forces to drive down costs.  
</p><p>One of the most promising areas of medical innovation is the expansion of telemedicine, where medical professionals treat patients across great distances using electronic communications. A significant barrier to telemedicine is the requirement that physicians obtain licenses from each state in which their current or potential patients are, or may be, located. We must fix this. It is easy to do, and it is common-sense policy.
</p><p>If elected I will immediately call together a Houston-based healthcare commission to tackle these problems.
</p><p><br>
<b>Fix the VA</b>
The VA has made improvements, but is still far from where it needs to be. I know, because I live with it every day. Our veterans are hurting, with suicide rates that are catastrophic at around 20 per day. Furthermore, excessive benefits for veterans that do not need them are costing the taxpayers billions while crowding out veterans who truly do need the care. We have to fix this. 
</p><p>If elected, I will keep going to the VA for my appointments, so that I continue to understand the patient experience at VA hospitals in Texas.
</p><p><br>
<b>American Energy</b>
Texas is an energy leader in the world, and I will always support the Texas energy industry. Our natural resources power our homes, businesses, and millions of other infrastructures around the country. Energy jobs are critical to our economy, and must be a priority when considering any type of regulation or law coming out of Washington.   
</p><p>We have to unleash the power of the Texas energy sector, and become the world leader in energy that we are meant to be. There is no good reason to rely on Middle Eastern oil anymore. We should be drilling for even more clean natural gas and allowing exports around the world, so that the everyone can enjoy cleaner and cheaper energy. Cheap energy has brought billions of people from the grips of poverty over the last century. Why stop now?
</p><p>We should be updating our infrastructure to prepare for future heavy rains and flooding. We cannot afford another broken reservoir in a future Hurricane Harvey.
</p><p>The President was right to pull out of the costly and meaningless Paris Climate Agreement. That agreement was merely value signaling, not good policy. We must use our money to develop better infrastructure, not engage in hopeless attacks on our energy industry. We must invest in new and cleaner technologies that can compete in the marketplace without expensive and distortionary government subsidies.
</p><p>Protecting our energy industry and protecting the environment are NOT mutually exclusive. Our country has led the world in reduced CO2 emissions while also growing our economy at three percent. We have been able to do this because the energy sector has revolutionized natural gas exploration, allowing cleaner energy to be used and reducing emissions drastically. We should all agree that we need to protect our natural treasures, lakes, rivers, forests, and oceans. “Don’t Mess With Texas” should mean something to all of us, as it certainly does for me. We have to keep Texas beautiful.
</p><p><br>
<b>Local Projects</b>
Elected office isn’t just about passing legislation, or having 1 out of 435 votes, it is about leadership. It is about using your power and influence for the good of the people in Houston.
</p><p>If elected, I will immediately begin two outreach programs for our children and teenagers. The first will be focused on children’s nutrition and physical fitness, the second will be focused on teens who may be susceptible to gang activity. I am uniquely qualified to do both, so please allow me to explain:
</p><p>Children’s Health: Growing up in Katy, my mother was a nutritionist for the local school district. As a kid, I thought it was so exciting when she would come sit with me during lunch in the cafeteria. It made me feel special, and I knew she not only cared about me, but all the kids and what they were eating. She knew the importance of a good diet for growing bodies.
</p><p>She passed away when I was only 10 years old, after fighting breast cancer for 5 years. It was devastating. Before she died, she told me that she knew I would soar to great heights. For me, that meant I needed to help other people, the way she did. 
</p><p>As a SEAL, I was constantly taught the value of physical fitness and good nutrition. Keeping our bodies fit and healthy is the building block for our success. If our health suffers, we cannot do the basic things necessary to be successful. We must teach our kids these lessons at an early age.
</p><p>I will not only be an advocate for healthier school lunches, but I will be on the ground working with kids on their physical fitness. I will encourage my fellow Navy SEALs to travel to Texas and do the same. We will show kids what is possible when you start building a strong foundation early on in life.
</p><p>Gang Violence: Houston continues to have a serious gang problem. It is absolutely poisonous to our young teens, resulting in criminal records, school drop-outs, and even deaths. Leading a successful life after being in a gang is extremely difficult. We need people who can relate to the choices teens are facing with respect to gang membership, and we need someone who can show them a better path.
</p><p>But we can’t just scare kids into making the right choices, we also have to show them a different path. I want to be able to show them what it really means to be part of a team, have camaraderie, and be truly tough. We will show them what life is like in the greatest and most elite team there is: the U.S. Navy SEALs. We must show teens that their choices now affect them forever; that they are capable of amazing things if they start on the right path now. There is no time to waste. We must reach them now.

The rising cost of health care is the number one issue I hear about from Texans on the campaign trail. Texas has the highest uninsured rate in the nation, and that’s unacceptable. Our current system is one of sky-high costs and inefficiencies. We must create a public option to make Medicare available for all those who want it. The best health care I’ve ever had was when I was on military-provided Tricare, similar to Medicare, and I believe that kind of high-quality care should be made available to all Americans. Every child should be covered, period.
</p><p>We can and must protect the progress made by the Affordable Care Act while making much-needed improvements. We cannot go back to the past when insurance companies were able to discriminate against those with preexisting conditions or sell junk plans that leave folks vulnerable when serious health issues or injuries occur.
</p><p>As your senator, I will stand up for Texans against special interests who put profits over people. Far too many folks here in Texas struggle to afford their prescriptions. I will advocate for measures to lower the cost of prescription drugs like allowing Medicare to negotiate prices with pharmaceutical companies. Additionally, I believe we must hold Big Pharma interests accountable for their part in the opioid epidemic that has ravaged so many communities here in Texas and beyond.
</p><p>I will oppose any effort to privatize, dismantle or undercut Medicare, including raising the eligibility age. Medicare and Social Security are not entitlements – they are promises made to every American. I will also oppose any “age tax” insurance companies seek to impose against older Americans.
</p><p><b>Women's Health</b><br>
I support federal law codifying Roe v. Wade so that reproductive rights are not subject to the whims of an increasingly partisan court system. It’s unacceptable that in 2019 a woman’s right to make medical decisions about her own body is under assault. I have had two difficult pregnancies, and I am grateful that during that time the government wasn’t standing between me and my doctor during very personal discussions. Politicians should not legislate a woman’s most intimate decisions. 
</p><p>Texans suffer from one of the worst maternal mortality rates in the developed world. We must support organizations that are providing our communities with sorely needed women’s health care services. I am opposed to efforts to shutter clinics that provide critical care to women all over Texas, especially in rural areas where loss of access to these clinics often means loss of health care. 
</p><p>We must provide support for women and families by increasing access to sex education, affordable over-the-counter contraception, and cost-effective childcare.
</p><p><b>Immigration</b><br>
For decades, career politicians have refused to fix our broken immigration system, and the consequences of their finger-pointing and inaction directly affect our day-to-day lives in Texas. We need to roll up our sleeves, collaborate with our border communities on solutions, and bring some common sense to the issue. 
</p><p>That means starting with permanently ending child separation, ensuring asylum seekers are not treated as criminals and their claims are properly processed, securing the border with effective procedures and technologies instead of wasting billions on an ineffective wall that would require robbing our military construction budget while seizing land from Texans, and building a path to citizenship for undocumented residents that prioritizes our security and reflects our core values as Americans — such as human dignity and our respect for the right of mankind to the pursuit of happiness.
</p><p>The increasing spread of anti-immigrant, white nationalist ideology is a serious threat to our safety, as proven by the shooting in El Paso that targeted Hispanic members of our community. I took an oath to support and defend our constitution against all enemies foreign and domestic, so I want to be crystal clear: we must mobilize against this epidemic of domestic terrorism here at home. I will always stand against this type of hateful rhetoric that has real consequences, and will call on elected leaders who amplify white nationalist rhetoric and racist dog-whistles to take ownership of the impact of their words and reverse course.
</p><p><b>Environment &amp; Climate Change</b><br>
As the mother of two little boys, climate change is one of the top reasons I decided to run for Senate. Climate change is one of the greatest threats to the health and safety of our communities, the world we are leaving for the next generation, and our national security. We cannot wait any longer to take action.
</p><p>In Texas, we are witnessing firsthand the effects of climate change. We’ve seen devastating hurricanes like Harvey, and multiple catastrophic, “500-year” floods in a matter of a few years. The status quo is not sustainable.
</p><p>We must set aggressive goals for the expansion of clean, renewable energy, and invest in clean energy manufacturing and sustainable transportation. Texas has the opportunity to be America’s leader in wind and solar energy, and we should use our natural, renewable resources to create jobs here in our state.
</p><p>We also must modernize our energy grid so it is equipped to handle increased load during peak usage.
</p><p><b>Education</b><br>
Every child, regardless of where they come from or how much money their family makes, should have access to an affordable and quality education. I will advocate for Texas public schools and teachers, because I believe an investment in strong public schools is an investment in our nation’s future. Teachers, educators, and school staff deserve to be treated with respect and to be paid salaries worthy of the critical service they provide to society.
</p><p>Far too many Texans struggle from crippling student loan debt. We must put an end to the government profiting off loans by lowering interest rates on student debt, while also ensuring all higher education — from apprenticeship programs to vocational training to degree programs — is more affordable for current and future students. Texans I’ve spoken to have told me that the requirement for an immediate start to repayment of student loans upon graduation or disenrollment has led to underemployment. Every student loan should have a grace period of at least several months during which the loan does not accrue interest, and that period should be paused if the individual enrolls in another course of training like pursuing a certificate or vocation.
</p><p>While a college degree is one avenue for achieving financial security, we also need to encourage support for and investment in vocational programs. Vocational programs expand trades sectors, which often provide secure, high-paying union jobs. Those working in these jobs have always been and will continue to be the backbone of our nation and the driving force toward improving our country’s infrastructure.
</p><p><b>Jobs &amp; the Economy</b><br>
I believe the country and our economy are stronger when our workers and their families are strong. Growing up, my mom worked three jobs just to pay the bills, and too many Texans face the same struggles today. That’s not the American dream. We need to raise wages and work to lower the cost of housing to ensure workers can provide for their families, and use tax credits and incentives to support small businesses instead of giving tax breaks to companies that ship their jobs overseas.
</p><p>My stepfather, who raised me as his own, was killed in a workplace accident. Because of the safety standards won by the labor movement, fewer families have to go through that devastation. I am grateful for the hard-fought victories of the labor movement that have created safer and fairer workplaces, and will protect that progress as a senator — I’ll always support the rights of workers to unionize and collectively bargain for safe and healthy working conditions, fair wages, and to secure benefits and pensions. In addition, I will fight efforts to cut pensions, Social Security, and Medicare.
</p><p>I believe in the promise of our country and the American dream, and that’s why it’s important to acknowledge that the scales have shifted to favor the rich and powerful over the working families that are left to contend with obscene medical costs, high rent and bills, student loan debt, and more. I opposed the 2017 tax cuts for big corporations and the wealthiest Americans, and would vote against any legislation that benefits corporations and the extremely wealthy while hurting working families trying to make ends meet.
</p><p><b>Military &amp; Veterans</b><br>
As a United States Air Force veteran who served three tours of duty in Afghanistan, I understand what our military and their families go through in a way that most politicians in DC can’t. We have a responsibility to the next generation that will wear our uniform: to give them the most stable global environment we possibly can.
</p><p>I will support responsible national security policies that recognize the value of seeking diplomatic solutions and employing strategic use of humanitarian assistance and trade negotiations, while insisting we reserve the deployment of American troops as a last resort. I believe a healthy State Department is our military’s first line of defense, and our relationships with our allies are fragile and critical to maintain.
</p><p>In addition, I know firsthand how difficult the transition back into civilian life can be. As your senator, I will always seek to make good on our promise to our service members by ensuring they receive quality health care, housing assistance, and help starting careers or businesses as they return from serving our country. I will stand against efforts to privatize the VA while supporting initiatives to streamline services for veterans to get better care when they need it. With record-high suicide rates and deployments than can strain family relationships, it’s critical we provide adequate mental health care to address the unique struggles of those who serve.
</p><p>My military service informs my view on government. When I think about my fellow soldiers who were with me the day my helicopter was shot down by the Taliban and how we worked together to complete our mission and get to safety, I think about how our government could take some cues from what we learn in the military. Unity, teamwork, and a shared mission is the only way to succeed.
</p><p><b>Gun Violence</b><br>
Multiple mass shootings have devastated Texas in recent years, and I believe it is well past time to take action to finally end the epidemic of gun violence.
</p><p>We must pass common-sense gun safety legislation to require background checks on every single gun sale, including closing the gun show loophole — a proposal that a recent Washington Post-ABC News survey found was supported by 88% of gun owners.
</p><p>We must also stop the sale of assault weapons to the public, pass red flag laws limiting access to firearms for domestic abusers — including closing the “boyfriend loophole” — and those who would commit acts of domestic terrorism, and fully fund the CDC to reverse the damage of the decades-long ban on gun violence research.
</p><p>I am also calling for state and local officials to end open carry. The reasons gun owners like me have for wanting to protect our Second Amendment rights — chief among them protecting our families — are not served by open carry. Open carry itself is an assault on every bystander within range, as we feel the need to flee and cover our children without the freedom to call law enforcement for help. We must empower people to “see something, say something.”
</p><p>The gun violence epidemic in this country reaches beyond the tragic mass shootings into our homes through domestic violence, accidental shootings, and suicides. As your senator, I will use my perspective as a mother, responsible gun owner, and combat veteran in my work to pass urgently-needed legislation to protect our communities.
</p><p><b>Clean Government</b><br>
Whenever someone tells me they don’t understand why a bill passed or decision was made in Washington, I always tell them to follow the money. That’s because far too many of our elected leaders make decisions about what legislation to support or oppose based on who is writing the biggest campaign checks — from the gun lobby to private prisons to Big Pharma — instead of what is best for their constituents.
</p><p>Americans are sick and tired of watching DC politicians put special interest donors and political games over the needs of the people. It is time to clean up our broken system and return the power back to people. That’s why I am refusing to accept any corporate PAC money and am proud to be endorsed by End Citizens United.
</p><p>Once elected, I will make it a priority to overturn partisan gerrymandering schemes that further polarize our politics, fight the increasingly-common voter suppression tactics designed to keep people from exercising their right to participate in our democracy, and pass comprehensive campaign finance and ethics reforms that ensure Washington is accountable to the voters — and no one else.<sup id=""cite_ref-46"" class=""reference""><a href=""#cite_note-46"">[46]</a></sup><sup id=""cite_ref-quotedisclaimer_47-0"" class=""reference""><a href=""#cite_note-quotedisclaimer-47"">[47]</a></sup>

				<p class=""survey-question"">What would be your top three priorities, if elected?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">* Protecting workers and communities in West Virginia as the U.S. transitions to a clean energy economy
</p><ul><li> Federal investment in safe drinking water infrastructure, rural broadband, transportation, and mine reclamation</li>
<li> Medicare for All universal healthcare<p></p></li></ul>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What areas of public policy are you personally passionate about?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I am particularly passionate about energy policy and transitioning our economy away from fossil fuels without sacrificing jobs, health benefits and pensions.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What do you perceive to be the United States’ greatest challenges as a nation over the next decade?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Our greatest challenges all stem from the growing economic inequality in our country and the concentration of more and more wealth and power in fewer and fewer hands. Until we can come together and take on the powerful special interests (fossil fuel companies, health insurance companies, agricultural monopolies, and others) that profit off of the way things are now, we will not be able to adequately address the crises of healthcare, climate change, addiction, etc.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">If you are not a current representative, are there certain committees that you would want to be a part of?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Energy &amp; Commerce
Natural Resources</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Both sitting representatives and candidates for office hear many personal stories from the residents of their district. Is there a story that you’ve heard that you found particularly touching, memorable, or impactful?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">A young man told me that he had intense leg pain for over a year but could not get it treated because he was on Medicaid and Medicaid's reimbursement rates are so low that doctors he went to were not interested in taking him seriously as a patient. When he finally got a different job and better health insurance, he found that he had a 10-inch cancerous tumor in his leg and that the cancer has spread throughout his body. If we had universal healthcare in this country, he would not be in his current life-threatening situation.</p>
