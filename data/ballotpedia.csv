				<p class=""survey-question"">What would be your top three priorities, if elected?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I stand on the principle that healthcare is a fundamental human right. I believe that a single payer Medicare for all system would bring us full and equitable access to quality healthcare for every resident in our country, including immigrants and undocumented people.  
Gun violence is a public health epidemic in our country, and I believe we need the research and resources to break the cycle. I will push for critical investments to be made in trauma-informed education, and advocate for increases in flexible funding to support innovative solutions to gun violence in local communities. 
The current criminal justice system profits off of mass incarceration, targets communities of color, and continues to uphold institutional racism. I am committed to holding law enforcement officers accountable, increasing officer and leadership diversity, and eliminating racial profiling.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What areas of public policy are you personally passionate about?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">In 2018, I built a statewide coalition that helped pass historic civil rights legislation to establish The Illinois Council on Women and Girls. This council prioritizes the needs of women, including women who identify as transgender, when evaluating state policies and allocating resources. In response to the Trump administration’s elimination of the White House Council on Women and Girls, I was determined to create a state level council in Illinois. I traveled the state listening to the needs and perspectives of hundreds of women in community focus groups. The bill that I co-authored passed with overwhelming bipartisan support in the Illinois General Assembly, and was signed into law on August 2018. It is important that there is now a body established in our state to evaluate policies and programs and to ensure that important decisions that involve women cannot be made without the input of women.</p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">What is the first historical event that happened in your lifetime that you remember? How old were you at the time?</p>

				<ul class=""key-messages"">
					<li>Healthcare. Healthcare is going to be my top priority when I get to congress. I know people who are paying more for insurance than they are for their housing and people who have had to file for bankruptcy after enormous medical costs. It's just not right. We finally have protections for those with pre-existing conditions, but costs are still too high. I'll FIGHT to protect coverage for pre-existing conditions, reduce prescription drug costs, and protect Medicare from cuts.</li>
					<li>Education. I am the first in my family to graduate from college and law school. Public and state education created the opportunity for me to succeed in the work force. I will oppose all versions of state funding for vouchers and for-profit charter schools that deplete state school funding. With college debt so high, I also want students to enter the work force with a step up, not anchored by student loan debt.</li>
					<li>Campaign Finance. A fundamental principle of our democracy is that every person gets one vote. That's no longer true today as corporations and special interest groups spend billions to get their candidates elected. The Citizens United ruling opened the floodgates and allowed the wealthiest individuals and corporations to influence our elections, drowning out the voices of everyday Americans. I support an amendment to overturn the Citizens United decision and measures to require more disclosure and transparency for outside groups.</li>

				<p class=""survey-question"">Who are you? Tell us about yourself in 300 words or less.</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">After working my way through college, medical school, and residency as a single father of 3, I moved to Southwest Florida with my children, my debt, and my high aspirations. 25 years ago, I opened a medical practice which would later grow to be one of the largest medical conglomerates in the area. I sold that practice in 2013, and I have been blessed beyond words ever since. I now live in Naples with my 3 children, 5 grandchildren, and my beautiful wife Olga. I've seen firsthand how big government has encroached on every aspect of our lives, and I've decided to do something about it.

However, to understand me It's simple. I believe that God created each of us to be free to make our own decisions but to coexist with our fellow man, but not rule over them.  Unfortunate law is necessary because some in today's society can not control themselves. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">

					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What is something that has been a struggle in your life?</p>

				<p class=""survey-response"">The U.S. House of Representatives is a balance of power between three branches of Government. It holds power to Impeach government officials, and the U.S. House holds the power of the purse to raise taxes as well as spending.</p>

			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Do you believe that two years is the right term length for representatives?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Yes, </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What are your thoughts on term limits?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I support term limits. I believe our founding fathers never intended for our nation to have career representatives in office for decades. The founding fathers trusted in the republic they had formed and the integrity of their fellowmen to limit themselves from being in public office for too long. If we look at President George Washington, he served two terms as the first U.S. president, from 1789 to 1797. Establishing a precedent that was followed and respected for decades until President Franklin D Roosevelt, where he was elected to four terms as President, from 1933 to 1945, although President Roosevelt did not complete his fourth term due to him succumbing to a stroke in April of 1945. As Thomas Jefferson wrote, \""I apprehend that the total abandonment of the principle of rotation in the offices of President and Senator will end in abuse\"" --Thomas Jefferson to E. Rutledge, 1788. He suggests that the idea was to serve in office for a brief time and mentor the next generation to follow in service. If term limits are good enough for the office of the President, then they are good enough for members of Congress.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">If you are not currently a member of your party’s leadership in the U.S. House of Representatives, would you be interested in joining the leadership? If so, in what role?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Yes, I will join the leadership, and I will look to lead in rolls of tax reform, reduce our deficit, Healthcare,  Government reform,  Immigration, and National Security.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Is there a particular representative, past or present, whom you want to model yourself after?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Abraham Lincoln, Teddy Rosevelt, George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, and Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Both sitting representatives and candidates for office hear many personal stories from the residents of their district. Is there a story that you’ve heard that you found particularly touching, memorable, or impactful?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I have heard from many residents that the current representative does equally represent them. The residents fill that Shelia Jackson Lee only represents blacks and illegal immigrants. The remaining district population does not fill heard or represented on issues that are important to them, and I agree. As a Representative, I should serve and hear everyone regardless of skin color, ethnic background, social background, sex, or any other reason. If I elected as the new representative for U.S. District 18, I will hear your concerns no matter who you are or where you come from. </p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">Who are you? Tell us about yourself in 300 words or less.</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Jesse Mermell has spent her life taking on the toughest fights - both big and small - to serve Massachusetts and turn our progressive values into reality.  From the front lines as a leader at Planned Parenthood and local elected official to the halls of the State House as a senior adviser to Governor Deval Patrick, Jesse is a public servant with a record of getting things done. She has successfully advocated on the most pressing issues facing our state and country alongside the state's progressive business leaders on behalf of policies to protect workers. She has rolled up her sleeves to tackle climate change and made the case for increased and equitable investments in transportation. For more than 20 years, Jesse's fights have been our fights - and she is ready to lead on them in Congress.

Jesse knows firsthand the good that can come when we work together and put our progressive ideas into action. She's running for Congress to use her experience to fight Donald Trump's dangerous agenda and to fight for the future that everyone in Massachusetts' Fourth Congressional District deserves.  Jesse is running for Congress to live, represent, and act on the values that her Grandma instilled in her decades ago: to give back to the community, to care about our neighbors, and to fight for others.

							<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What areas of public policy are you personally passionate about?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">To serve her community, Jesse became the youngest person elected to the Brookline Select Board. As a Select Board Member, Jesse fought to make a difference in people's everyday lives, from potholes and trash pick-up to leading the charge on climate change by banning plastic bags and styrofoam, updating the Town's climate action plan, and establishing Climate Week to encourage learning and engagement in Brookline around climate change. Jesse later became Governor Deval Patrick's Communications Director where she helped the Governor make good on his progressive platform for Massachusetts and, with his support, spearheaded the Governor's Strong Women Strong Families initiative.  In the fight for workers' rights, increasing the minimum wage, equal pay, earned sick time, equitable investments in transportation, and paid family and medical leave, Jesse served as President for the Alliance for Business Leadership. As President, Jesse worked with progressive business leaders across Massachusetts, promoting the belief that social responsibility and the sustainable growth of the Massachusetts economy go hand in hand. To fight for women's rights and our progressive values, Jesse served as the Executive Director of the Massachusetts Women's Political Caucus and the Vice President for External Affairs at Planned Parenthood League of Massachusetts where she fought for comprehensive sex education in public schools and for the inclusion of birth control and other reproductive health care.</p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">Who are you? Tell us about yourself in 300 words or less.</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">  I am Richard Goble, running for U.S. Congressman in District 7.  I support small businesses and stand for the second amendment.  From living in this district as well, I will support and defend each and everyone of you.</p>
			</div>
						    <div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Please list below 3 key messages of your campaign. What are the main points you want voters to remember about your goals for your time in office?</p>
				<ul class=""key-messages"">
					<li>End the Unnecessary Endless Wars, and Maintain the Best Military and Lower Taxes for All Working People.</li>
					<li>Improve Our Roads and Transportation Systems, Improve Economic Opportunity and Access to the Capital Markets for All </li>
					<li>Protect Free Speech, Right to Protect Ourselves, Protect the Health of the Unborn and Women Health.</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
							<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What areas of public policy are you personally passionate about?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Without capitalism, our country will lose our great safety nets and the ability to properly protect our people.  All people and small businesses should have uninhibited access to the capital markets, which will permit our country, our people, and our standard of living to continue to flourish!

Our roads in Central Florida need improving and need more federal dollars to help with these improvements.  A train system should not be stopping auto traffic and should be forcing our county governments to fund these failing transportation programs. 

The first Amendment and Second Amendment to our Constitution need to be protected. Without our Second Amendment rights, we greatly risk losing our First Amendment Rights.

Lowering taxes for all working people is always important and should be the thoroughly address in every federal budget bill.

Supporting our great President, Donald J. Trump, is very important while he is keeping his promises and draining the swamp and making our Country Great Again! 

Supporting and protecting the health of the unborn and women's health are extremely important.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Who do you look up to? Whose example would you like to follow, and why?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">The person I most look up to is Ronald Reagan because of his  social and leadership skills. I would like to follow Ronald Reagan because he made a difference and improved the human condition for hundreds of millions of  people.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What is the first historical event that happened in your lifetime that you remember? How old were you at the time?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">The first historical event  that I remember is watching Neil Armstrong take his first steps on the moon in 1969. At the time I was 8 years old, remembering how hugely monumental this event was to the world . </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What was your very first job? How long did you have it?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">The first job I had was a paperboy in Enon, Ohio at the age of 12. I had this job for two years delivering newspapers in snow, sleet, and rain. Even when the Ohio roads were closed because of weather, I still delivered the newspaper daily on my bicycle.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What qualities does the U.S. House of Representatives possess that makes it unique as an institution?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">There are 435 U.S. House of Representatives each with one vote.  It is extremely important that our District 7 in Central Florida vote is clearly reflected of the views of our district. That one vote is not used to further benefit the large donars and oligarchs and instead is used to greatly benefit our local roads,  medical care, financial freedom, an d the continued pursuit of happiness.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What do you perceive to be the United States’ greatest challenges as a nation over the next decade?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Our greatest challenge is teaching and using Capitalism to continue to give every U.S. citizen the best opportunity to be able to have the best life, the best liberty, and the continuous pursuit of happiness.

 Another challenge is eliminating racism, hate, corruption, corporate non-utility monopolies.

Providing and improving healthcare for all those in need is a never ending challenge that i'm willing to continue to fight for as well.

Securing more federal dollars to improve our Central Florida roads and highways.</p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">Please list below 3 key messages of your campaign. What are the main points you want voters to remember about your goals for your time in office?</p>
				<ul class=""key-messages"">
					<li>Reign in the Federal debt.  Balanced budget amendment.  When the economy is strong, work for a surplus budget and pay down the debt</li>
					<li>The 2 party system is no longer working.  A 3rd block of 3rd party / independent representatives is required to keep either of the major parties from an outright majority.  Our democracy will change dramatically for the better</li>
					<li>Ohio is a net donor in pay-ins to the federal system.  We need to make sure that we get an equal payout to support our needs compared to what we pay in.</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
							<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What areas of public policy are you personally passionate about?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Individual liberties, budget, immigration, foreign trade, separation of powers</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Who do you look up to? Whose example would you like to follow, and why?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I look up to my maternal grandfather.  He was once described to me as \""a person I have known for all of my life, and I can't remember ever having a negative personal interaction with him\"".  I'm not sure there is any better description to which a person should aspire</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What do you believe are the core responsibilities for someone elected to this office?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Represent the constituency in the federal government.  Report the business of the federal government to the constituency.  Country over party; Branch over party.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What legacy would you like to leave?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">An independent voice that helped focus the House back to the business of governing the federally mandated issues and not dividing the country apart through politics.  Reducing the federal debt so that our children and grandchildren do not have to deal with a burden that we leave to them</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What qualities does the U.S. House of Representatives possess that makes it unique as an institution?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">It is the elected body that is closest to the citizenry.  Therefore it has the powers that most directly affect the population:  power of the purse, power to declare war and power to impeach</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Do you believe that it's beneficial for representatives to have previous experience in government or politics?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">No, the position of \""representative' wasn't meant to be a career position.  In fact, it wasn't even supposed to be a full-time position.  Expansive growth of the federal government at the expense of States' Rights have morphed it into a body that needs to be reset quite a bit.</p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">If you are not a current representative, are there certain committees that you would want to be a part of?</p>

					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Do you believe that two years is the right term length for representatives?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Absolutely, and with term limits.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What are your thoughts on term limits?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Absolutely necessary.  Politician should not be a profession.  We decided that we didn't want a ruling class about 244 years ago.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Is there a particular representative, past or present, whom you want to model yourself after?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Justin Amash</p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">Who are you? Tell us about yourself in 300 words or less.</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Solomon is a 27-year-old medical student from the University of Michigan. He is a Progressive taking a leave of absence from school to run because he is done waiting on our politicians to act. As a grassroots activist, he founded the Michigan Resistance, which has made tens of thousands of calls to stop bad bills in our state. He's a proud Muslim American, a child of Pakistani immigrants, and he grew up in Ann Arbor. As an activist he, like many others, has been told to wait our turn, that change will come but we just have to wait. We're #DoneWaiting. Solomon is challenging an establishment democratic dynasty; a member of the Dingell family has held Michigan's 12th congressional district for more than 85 years.

						    <div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Please list below 3 key messages of your campaign. What are the main points you want voters to remember about your goals for your time in office?</p>
				<ul class=""key-messages"">
					<li>A Green New Deal: revolutionizing our economy to prepare for the Climate Crisis that we are entering.</li>
					<li>Medicare-For-All: a single-payer system of health insurance that removes corporate greed and profit from the equation.</li>
					<li>Tuition-Free Education and Eliminating Student Debt: Expanding public k-12 education to include 4-year colleges.</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
							<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What areas of public policy are you personally passionate about?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">As a medical graduate student on leave, Solomon is very passionate about the importance of healthcare reform and making sure everyone can afford coverage and access to high-quality expansive coverage. This is in addition to the urgency of making sure everyone can access life-saving medication that is far too often overpriced for the benefit of the drug-producing companies that profit off of the despair of the American people.  Removing the legalized bribery utilized by the pharmaceutical companies and insurance companies to control members of both the Republican and Democratic parties is the first step to take back our country. Companies have bought politicians and thus heavily influenced the public policy of the United States government. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Who do you look up to? Whose example would you like to follow, and why?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I look up to Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez because of the movement she has contributed to, and because if she had not run in her district, I would have not believed that I had a chance against the establishment candidate in my district. AOC is not the only individual who has participated in the revitalized grassroots movement, but she is often the person who is given the most criticism. This is largely because of her gender and her race, but I respect how graceful she has been in the spotlight, and I would love to follower her example of not only wining the district that I am running in, but championing my constituency, and America as a whole, as well as she does. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What characteristics or principles are most important for an elected official?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I believe transparency and self-reflection are very important for an elected official to hold. Transparency is important because, for so long, the politicians in this country have taken dark money and been bought out by people who do not reside in their district, or by those who fight for policy that would hurt the people in their district. I believe that self-reflection is also extremely important because if an official reflects on the decisions they have made, and not only their effects on the representative's constituency but the country as a whole, this allows for the representatives to continue to uphold the needs of their community. Reflection also allows for a representative to combat their pride and admit when they have misstepped, and to be transparent about their decisions. An elected official should not want to hide who they are getting money from or what bills they have championed in the past, they should have given their decisions enough critical thought to show to the public, and they should reflect on those decisions in an honest way, and learn from their mistakes.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What do you believe are the core responsibilities for someone elected to this office?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I believe the core responsibility of an elected official is to represent the working people that reside in their district, and therefore, improve their conditions. This means that they will be allegiant only to their constituency, and they will fight for issues that effect their community, and the larger scope of working class people.  </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What legacy would you like to leave?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Here is what I want to do while I'm in office: I want to spearhead a Green New Deal, make college free, eliminate student debt, get big money out of politics, and enact a single-payer Medicare for All system to ensure that healthcare is a human right. I want my legacy to be that I was at the forefront of the fights to enact these pieces of legislation. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What is the first historical event that happened in your lifetime that you remember? How old were you at the time?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">The first major historical event I remember in my lifetime was 9/11, and I was 8 years old. This was obviously a huge tragedy, and I remember the adults around me being absolutely devastated, but I did not quite understand the nuances what was going on. Also, as a Muslim in America growing up post-9/11, many people were aware of my identity and a lot of those people held certain prejudices and  assumptions about me. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What was your very first job? How long did you have it?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I was an RA during my undergraduate years at Dartmouth, and I learned so many things through that job. My favorite aspect of being an RA was that it allowed me to create a community. This is something I feel to be very important because college is a huge transition for a lot of people, and it was an honor to be the one to create a welcoming environment for a lot of these kids. I had this job for 1 year.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What was the last song that got stuck in your head?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Roxanne by Arizona Zervas </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What qualities does the U.S. House of Representatives possess that makes it unique as an institution?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">The U.S. House of Representatives is unique because it allows for a local representative to vote on federal legislation. This puts the members of congress in a unique position, and allows for them to champion for problems in their district at a federal level. This way, the solutions can not only be applied to their own district, but can benefit people all over America. If done right, these representatives are simultaneously local and federal officials.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Do you believe that it's beneficial for representatives to have previous experience in government or politics?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I believe that the kind of experience matters more than the years of experience. For example, many people in congress today have experience with taking corporate PAC money, campaigning on issues that appease their elite supporters, or even as former lobbyists for large corporations. This is not the type of experience that I think is important, but this is often what is referred to as the 'right' kind of experience in politics. I believe, however, that the most important experience is in grassroots organizing, and being a participant in bottom-up movements. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What do you perceive to be the United States’ greatest challenges as a nation over the next decade?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I believe that the climate crisis will be the United States', and the world's, greatest challenge over the next decade. I believe this because of the reports from thousands of scientists, and the UN backs this claim, and the environmental degradation will continue to displace thousands of people, deplete our resources, as well as plunge us into a global emergency.  This is why we need a Green New Deal. Today is a defining moment for our civilization, and I will do everything I can to slow this crisis. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Do you believe that two years is the right term length for representatives?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I do believe that 2 years is the right term length for representatives because I think it is important that the public has a chance to re elect leadership every few years. This theoretically should keep the elected official accountable to the public, however much of the time the official is not transparent about their political endeavors, and other factors such as name recognition kind of cloud this accountability.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Is there a particular representative, past or present, whom you want to model yourself after?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Like I said, I really respect Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. She won in a district whose interests had been inadequately represented for so long, and I really respect how valiantly she champions issues that affect her constituency. I do not think I would have taken leave from medical school and ran in my district if she had not won in her district, because I can see so many parallels between the individuals she represents and those I am hoping to represent.  </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Both sitting representatives and candidates for office hear many personal stories from the residents of their district. Is there a story that you’ve heard that you found particularly touching, memorable, or impactful?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">A specific moment I had was with a student at one of the Universities in my district stands out to me. I am very lucky to be able to work with so many students, as my district has 6 colleges. This student told me that they had married one of their friends in order to get more financial aid from their University and to be declared 'independent' from their parents, and once they were graduated, they planned to divorce and go their separate ways. This story baffled me. Is our student debt crisis so bad, that people are deciding to marry each other just to receive more financial support? This is just one example of the countless stories I have heard while knocking doors and phone banking, but the revealing nature of this story gave me more of a perspective on the lengths people are needing to go in order to get an affordable education in this country.</p>

							<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What areas of public policy are you personally passionate about?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Health care. Obamacare has been devastating for many in Idaho, precipitating the loss of insurance plans and doctors, and causing premiums to skyrocket. Obamacare must be repealed. Idaho deserve healthcare freedom. We must introduce free market principles that empower patients by giving more choices, at lower costs. Ray favors tax-free health savings accounts, portable insurance policies, and removing artificial state barriers that drive costs up.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Who do you look up to? Whose example would you like to follow, and why?</p>

				<p class=""survey-response"">Congruence-a genuineness and being authentic. No one is perfect, we all have faults. A strong leader is someone that is willing work with others, not always taking the lead, but understands sharing responsibility builds leadership and prepares the next person to take on the role of leadership.</p>

			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What do you perceive to be the United States’ greatest challenges as a nation over the next decade?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Our country has to focus on balancing a budget, being good stewards of our nation. We have to live within out means and realize the purpose of a budget is long term sustainability as a nation. Climate change is real, we are in a position today to help reverse the damage. Once we take action we can start moving forward on finding solutions if we all work together. Mental health in our youth, veterans, and senior citizens are extremely pressing. The number of mental health related incidents are increasing, limited resources, and limit personnel. The stigma of mental health is costing more lives today than any other time in our history.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What qualities does the U.S. Senate possess that makes it unique as an institution?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Strength, our Senate has stood the test of time. The Senate is an institution is established. We know it can work. We know that if our leadership faced the facts they would know too that currently our government is being attacked within, this attack is more dangerously than any foreign power. We have to clean house and return to the basics. Look at the opportunity to grow, develop, and strengthen the country through cooperative relationships.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Do you believe that it’s beneficial for senators to have previous experience in government or politics?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I do not believe that it is beneficial in the since that an American without experience should be dismissed. When our country was founded our government consisted of farmers, small business leaders, and yes politicians. I think that the diversity is important, I feel that we all govern throughout our life and have experiences that are relevant. If we get back to the basics and really center on the job at hand, past governmental experiences would not matter and we would probably get more done.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What do you think of the filibuster?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I feel strongly we have a right to take up a cause, that being said, the cause has to justify the means.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What criteria would you apply when deciding whether to confirm presidential appointees?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I feel that the whole picture should be presented. I say that meaning, out past cannot define us, are adult actions should be the focal point of discussion. We often do not change to much, we might be better at hiding things, but the truth will come out. I think everyone should be given the benefit of the doubt, and let the evidence of their character define the person.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Do you believe it’s beneficial to build relationships with other senators?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Strong relationships are the fundamental key to growth, understanding and open communication that leads to compromise and action.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">If you are not a current senator, are there certain committees that you would want to be a part of?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I would like to work on committees that engage change. I feel that I lean more toward education, farming,military, foreign and domestic affairs committees. My first committee choice would be the Health, Education, Labor, and Pension Committee. This committee includes areas that I am passionate about like mental health care in schools. Second committee choice would be Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry our of default of coming from a rural community and state where agriculture is in fabric of many lives in Kentucky. Third committee choice would be Foreign Affairs, I feel that relationships are very important, building strong alliances will only strengthen our position as a world power. Fourth would be the Veterans or Homeland Security and Government Affairs. I feel that security is very important and those that provide us security should be allocated resources.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">If you are not currently a member of your party’s leadership in the U.S. Senate, would you be interested in joining the leadership? If so, in what role?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I would take a leadership role in US Senate, I think that most candidate that enter the race to be a lead. Not all can be a leader and not all leaders can lead. I think that leadership is about building and providing opportunities to create leaders.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Is there a particular senator, past or present, whom you want to model yourself after?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I honor and respect W. Ford from Kentucky. I had the honor and pleasure to meet and speak to him. He inspired me to make change in my own life. I have also admired T.

				<p class=""survey-question"">Who are you? Tell us about yourself in 300 words or less.</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Hilary Turner has been a committed advocate for social justice and environmental protection. She grew up in Pensacola, Florida and received her Bachelors degree in International Studies with a minor in Environmental Science from the University of West Florida. 

In college, she founded and lead a Progressive Student Alliance, where she organized students to start a community garden, advocated for fair-trade and sustainability, organized against police brutality in Pensacola after the death of Victor Steen, and  organized peace demonstrations.

During her junior year, she worked on a class-action lawsuit against Massey Coal Company and Don Blankenship in a case in Logan County, West Virginia, where 700 families had their well-water poisoned.

She also spent a year studying sustainable permaculture and agriculture in Brazil.

In the years after college, Turner worked in education as a teacher in public schools and private schools, and in healthcare as a massage therapist.

In 2015 through 2016, Turner was an organizer for Bernie Sanders. After Sanders' primary loss, she moved to her family's farm in West Virginia, where she experienced the 2016 thousand-year floods. Turner now has a daughter, and is dedicated to creating a sustainable world for all future generations.</p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">What would be your top three priorities, if elected?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Invest in education for today and tomorrow: Let's invest more in our students, give teachers the freedom to teach to the individual students--not the test, reduce class size, lower or eliminate student debt, and help us compete globally with the best trained talent and skilled labor.

Build an economy that works for everyone: Let's make sure more people are benefiting when productivity and the economy improve. It's time to stop giving away our tax dollars to the most profitable companies through tax breaks that aren't creating new jobs. Let's strengthen unions, raise the minimum wage, and help rebuild the middle class.

Champion social justice and protecting the environment: Let's prohibit discrimination in Michigan based on sexual orientation and gender identity by expanding the Elliott-Larsen Civil Rights Act, protect a women's right to choose, end mass incarceration and reform the criminal justice system, promote a caring economy to deal with issues related to long-term care, earn paid sick and family leave time, and make our hospitals safer by improving our laws related to nursing and healthcare. Let's work together to protect our drinking water from lead, PFAS, and other contaminants, while tackling global warming.

Unrig our Democracy: Let's end gerrymandering, improve access to the ballot, end the legislator-to-lobbyist pipeline caused by term-limits, and reduce the role of money in politics.</p>

people power the government. Coming from a family of teachers, I have work to continue

fighting for education for today and tomorrow, lowering class size, and reducing student debt.

As a small business owner, I know we need to do more to raise wages, make sure economic

improvements reach the pockets of working people, and end giveaways to the most profitable

companies. Finally, we need to protect the environment, promote social justice, and unrig our

democracy. There's a lot of work to do, but together we can get it done.</p>

			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What is your favorite holiday? Why?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Thanksgiving - my wife's family always makes ""Grandma Mary's stuffing"", and it very well may be heaven on a plate.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Do you believe that it’s beneficial for state legislators to have previous experience in government or politics?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Not necessarily - new ideas and visions are always needed to keep from becoming stagnant.  When I was in the Navy, the worst answer to give was ""that's how we've always done it""...if entire legislative bodies are made up of career politicians, they can become mired in outdated methods.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What do you perceive to be your state’s greatest challenges over the next decade?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Handling our projected extreme population growth and balancing it with development and our outdated transportation system.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Do you believe it’s beneficial to build relationships with other legislators? Please explain your answer.</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Yes - especially of the opposing party.  Negotiation and debate are always more effective with someone you are familiar with than a stranger.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What process do you favor for redistricting?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">As simple as possible - basically large rectangles that meet the population requirements.  We need to get rid of the rampant gerrymandering so districts can accurately reflect the people who live there.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Both sitting legislators and candidates for office hear many personal stories from the residents of their district. Is there a story that you’ve heard that you found particularly touching, memorable, or impactful?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">When discussing LGBT equality, I told a constituent about my brother-in-law and his husband (who adopted a newborn), and how some members of the opposing party think that that should be illegal based on religious reasons.  She told me ""I grew up in an abusive household, I would have loved having one caring parent, let alone two"".  Perspective is everything</p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">What would be your top three priorities, if elected?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Ending the Federal Reserve, Fixing Immigration/Border Security, Exiting the United Nations.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What areas of public policy are you personally passionate about?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Public policy is my life. I don't play Golf - my focus is legislation and policy almost exclusively. While everyone else is doing whatever it is they're doing, I'll be working.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Who do you look up to? Whose example would you like to follow, and why?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I like the classical American writers like John Locke, Patrick Henry and Lysander Spooner who shaped our nation with their ideas, I've read a wide range of history and philosophy books, even those by a great many authors that I disagree with.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">

				<p class=""survey-response"">Man, Economy and State by Murray Rothbard, for explicitly financial policy, The Mystery of Banking by Murray Rothbard</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What characteristics or principles are most important for an elected official?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Work ethic is the key to any field. Just show up a lot more often, dig your heels in and fight. With enough sheer willpower, you can eventually move mountains no matter where you began in life. Never give up no matter what people say about you.</p>

					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What qualities do you possess that you believe would make you a successful officeholder?</p>

			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What do you believe are the core responsibilities for someone elected to this office?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">The job of a US Senator is to write and vote on policy measures, and participate in committees that facilitate the process. 
The secondary job, the outside job, is to keep an open door and listen to constituents. Both jobs are very important, but most candidates are either good at one or the other.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What legacy would you like to leave?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I could care less about something like ""legacy."" Legacy is the most vapid word in the human language. It appeals to people who are self-obsessed and vain. My goal is to contribute to the people, I am interested in their liberty, not creating some sort of personal legacy for myself.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What is the first historical event that happened in your lifetime that you remember? How old were you at the time?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I was born into the fall of the Berlin Wall. On my 5th birthday, November 9th of 1989, the monument to Socialism was removed, and at Midnight the people were free to reunite under the new banners of liberty and capitalism. My entire life is about defeating socialism in all forms - that is why my campaign is to Defeat Socialism Again.</p>

					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What was your very first job? How long did you have it?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I was a rough youth, so I began cleaning construction bins as part of a youth crew around the time I was 9-10 years old. During my teenage years I was a farm-hand on an equestrian farm, a kennel hand for dogs and cats, a call center employee, a supervisor, a canvasser, a landscaper, a grocery store worker. As an adult I became a bartender, a DJ, a musician, and I finally settled into technology, while also working in freelance journalism as a secondary source of income. I represent the overworked and the underpaid, the most dedicated people in our society, the survivors.</p>

					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What happened on your most awkward date?</p>

					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What is your favorite holiday? Why?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">July 4th. My primary focus is Liberty, so I deeply believe in Independence Day. 
I also like the end of year cycle (Thanksgiving, Christmas, Hanukkah, etc.) because it's a great time to spend with friends and family.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What is your favorite book? Why?</p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">What is your favorite thing in your home or apartment? Why?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">My computer. I'm committed to minimalism, so I don't own a lot of things - my computer is the most useful.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What was the last song that got stuck in your head?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">The Ecstasy of Gold by Ennio Morricone, from the film ""The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly.""</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What is something that has been a struggle in your life?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I've been working class for my entire life. My dream has always been to simply get the same opportunities that everyone else did - my friends and family have watched me fight and struggle my whole life through. Now, here is my opportunity to finally liberate myself from the things that have weighed me down for so long. In exchange for dedicating my life to public service and focusing on my contributions to The People and our nation, I get a pretty good salary and the chance to finally claim what should have been mine a long time ago. It's about overcoming adversity. I've been censored, cast out, lied about, I've had to fight for so long. But here when I win, my victory becomes permanent. In exchange for giving everything I have, I claim my life, I get the prize of being myself, I get to finally make large scale change in the world, I get to spread my ideas, my goals, my dreams. I get to fight for the portion of society that isn't controlled by the donor class, the rich establishment, the in-crowd.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What qualities does the U.S. Senate possess that makes it unique as an institution?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">The US Senate has the 17th Amendment, which is popular voting for the election of Senators by States. The 17th Amendment was established to prevent elections from being ""bought and sold"" in the hopes of defeating electoral corruption, with the premise being based on the skill and competency of candidates rather than their prosperity or the will of the donor class. Historically, this has eroded over time, along with our other Constitutional Rights, but the premise is still uniquely that of the Senate - that the Senators of the United States should be the most competent and merited people in all of the legislature. However, over time, the Seventeenth Amendment became leverage for the appointment of exiting Senators to Executive Positions without penalty - thus giving way to the very ""bought and sold"" mentality the Amendment was written to defeat. A level of nepotism now exists within our government that gives way to the 17-25% approval rating of our Congress - and that is why the uniquely intelligent and merited must reclaim our Senate from the insider class.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Do you believe that it’s beneficial for senators to have previous experience in government or politics?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Career politicians are generally terrible. Political education is more important than having won previous elections - the career politicians don't win on merit, they win on what is essentially political welfare. The lobbyists give them taxpayer dollars, like my opponent in this primary, the RNC and NRSC have already leapt to her aid, giving her millions of dollars in taxpayer money, even though Martha McSally lost the previous election and isn't the true incumbent in this election. Likewise, the Democrats similarly incubated Kyrsten Sinema, giving her the opportunity to win based on insider status. The Parties and the system are supposed to help all candidates, so that The People can pick the winners - but 1 or 2 debates is hardly enough for anyone to decide, and the candidates are often reading from a script presented to them by their donors. That is why the Sinema/McSally ""debate"" of 2018 was so terrible, both of them were simply reading donor talking points, there was no actual debate happening, it was only televised on a local level, when it should have been televised on a national level. The People want real debates, not scripted talking points. And the news media, they really went out of their way to suppress my campaign, right now I'm on a Fox News blacklist, I'm on a CNN blacklist and an MSNBC blacklist, a lot of the local stations won't even talk to me, there's a suppression of debate and information happening, which really hurts The People and their ability to vote. So in turn the only organizations that wrote about my campaign were Far Left donor shacks, like the Daily Beast where Chelsea Clinton sits on the board. There's a genuine fear of open information in both parties, and they've gone out of their way to censor candidates - especially those who are good at debates, there is no way that Martha McSally, Kyrsten Sinema, Mark Kelly or anyone else can beat me at any form of debate. It's not possible for them, the Press is aware of that.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What do you think of the filibuster?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I think the filibuster is incredible. This is one of the areas where the President - I deeply like him but he's wrong here - if the Republicans start bringing in their new energetic and tough base like me that can stand on our feet for days on end, we could gridlock the entire process of the other Party. Filibusters measure will and physical strength. I can see why the older establishment folks and RINOs don't like it, they can barely get through a 15 minute session without help from their congressional aides. I would absolutely love to gridlock the Democrats until they come to the table, until they start wanting to have real discussions about border security and making deals. Until we can fix our immigration process - it takes 12 years for our Federal Government to know if someone is legal or not on average - gridlocks should happen. If we're not going to negotiate, why not just shut down the whole mess? The establishment will learn to respect the will of The People, and the filibuster is a tool of the people. I intend to start filibustering stupid bills and bad ideas the moment I'm elected. And believe me, there are many stupid bills and bad ideas, and I will take them on and defeat them.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What criteria would you apply when deciding whether to confirm presidential appointees?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">The biggest problem with Court Appointees is lifetime appointments. We need to do away with lifetime appointments, they lead to sloth and bench-ruling behavior, plus corruption. I support Term Limits - not only for elected officials but for Judges too. An ideal for a Supreme Court Judge would be 2-8 years, and likewise for the lesser Courts. This also gives more good justices the chance to leave their mark on the High Courts, and reduces the weight and burden of confirmations - at most, a Justice should have a relatively short time on the Court, to narrow their scope and ability to hijack the Laws of the Land, and subsequently to narrow the ability of any given Executive Branch to taper the field. The key to Checks and Balances is that they are just that - Checks and Balances. A lifetime appointment is neither a check nor a balance.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What do you perceive to be the United States’ greatest challenges as a nation over the next decade?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">The United Nations has destabilized and weakened us, the Federal Reserve has imperiled our domestic monetary policy, and our international fiscal policy is mired by bad and unnecessary trade policy. We've essentially re-authorized the bad provisions of previous bad trade deals as part of our current trade policy as a stop-gap measure, and that's not going to work in the long run. We need to immediately balance our budget - even if that means I have to personally filibuster every excessive spending bill that comes through - both of our political parties are insistent upon passing fiscally irresponsible legislation like our annual NDAA and the previously signed Omnibus, and our Federal Budget has grown to $5T annually, with our debt growing to $24T. That's not free, we're playing for that as it lowers the value of our dollar. When you go to the store and milk is $6 a gallon, that's the result of refusing to balance the budget. So I'll make budget balance happen - we're going to stop pretending that the US Treasury and Federal Reserve can print unlimited money without consequence. There are very real consequences and our working and middle class are paying for them now. If I had more rich donor friends, like my primary opponents, I'd have already won this election - as it stands now it's a monetary footrace, and many people in the donor class are deliberately sabotaging our Federal Budget, to deliberately cripple the dollar and the opportunity of the working and middle class to have class mobility, to move upwards based on their merits. The answer is not Socialism, The People don't need ""new powers"" appointed to them - they just need their original money back. Moneyprinting is counterfeiting, taxation is theft, and the people need a full restoration of the purchasing power and earned money that the Federal Government has stolen from them during their lifetimes. We're going to get all of that back, and it's going to be spectacular.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Do you believe it’s beneficial to build relationships with other senators?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Absolutely, it's beneficial to work with as many people as possible. A key part of defeating the gridlock will be identifying those who won't play ball. The donor class tells people to make nice. But when I win, I don't have to make nice, I can call out the people who aren't doing their jobs and make them play ball. It's going to be non-stop negotiating - and those who won't deal, I'll make sure they don't get re-elected. We're going to have a united, aggressive Republican Party under my future leadership, a Party that creates negotiations and deals, and I will lead by example. I will get a lot of people in and we're going to work it out no matter how long it takes.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">If you are not a current senator, are there certain committees that you would want to be a part of?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">As many as possible. In particular, I want to be part of the Budget Committee, they desperately need someone there who isn't a tax-and-spend blank check advocate, and likewise for Banking/Housing/Urban Affairs, Appropriations, Commerce, Science, and Transportation, Energy and Natural Resources, Foreign Relations, Indian Affairs, Intelligence, Rules and Administration, and Small Business and Entrepreneurship.</p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">If you are not currently a member of your party’s leadership in the U.S. Senate, would you be interested in joining the leadership? If so, in what role?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">In time, I want to be the Republican Senate Leader.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Is there a particular senator, past or present, whom you want to model yourself after?</p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">Who are you? Tell us about yourself in 300 words or less.</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">In October of 2018, Allen became the Democratic Nominee for the U.S. House of Representatives to represent Florida's 17th Congressional District claiming a 52 percent victory over numerous contenders during the special primary election. He then made an impressive showing on November 6th general election to his opponent, an experienced and well-known Senator who served three terms in the Florida Senate. Allen then won nearly 40% of the vote, which was a remarkable showing for Allen, considering that his name was not even placed on the ballots, which were already printed when he entered the race.  Allen's platform is centered around improving the quality of life for all citizens. Allen believes in protecting the environment, securing social security, healthcare, disability benefits, the rights of women and veterans care. Allen believes in creating good paying jobs, sustainable agricultural development,  developing green solutions for a stronger, cleaner and safer environment for everyone to enjoy. Allen believes in developing policies that give consideration to strengthen families. Allen is a husband, father and entrepreneur and is running for US House of Representatives in Florida's 17th Congressional District to be the voice of the people in Congress.</p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">Who are you? Tell us about yourself in 300 words or less.</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Son to a single mother and brother of two younger sisters, all survivors of physical abuse. Growing up, his mother relocated Alan and his sisters many times in order to escape abuse and to pursue a better life. Alan attended 16 different schools from kindergarten through high school, he was a ward of the state for a span of five years in foster care and grew up in more than 16 different cities throughout Michigan. At age 16 he took a year off from school to work helping to support his mother and sisters. From an early age, Alan learned the importance of demonstrating resilience, courage, and refusal to give up in face of anything life could throw at him.

During his junior and senior years, River Rouge High School employed Alan as network administrator in charge of 250 desktop workstations. He maintained the school's server and trained 4 other students to help maintain the network for the school. During his senior year, aspiring to become a leader and affect community change, he ran for city council in the city of River Rouge. Although he did not win the race, he was the youngest candidate in city history. Later that year, he answered the call to become a US Marine, which evolved into a lifelong commitment. 

He served in the United States Marine Corps as a Reservist for 20 years volunteering for 5 deployments consisting of combat and support of combat operations roles. He is a combat veteran with experience in many diverse cultures including 19 Countries globally as a...</p>

				<p class=""survey-response"">Spartan King Leonidas: His devotion to his God, Faith, Family, Country, Citizens and Honor through his service as a warrior and representative.

President George Washington: He turned down the establishment of a monarchy when the Americans offered him a kingship after winning the revolutionary war. 
President Abraham Lincoln: He united the country and abolished slavery.

				<p class=""survey-response"">The United States Constitution, The book \""The Federalist\"", the \""Bible\"", and \""The Meditations of Marcus Aurelius\"".</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What characteristics or principles are most important for an elected official?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">1. Know yourself and seek self-improvement 2. Be technically and tactically proficient 3. Know your constituents and look out for their welfare 4. Keep your constituents informed 5. Set the example 6. Ensure the task is understood, supervised, and accomplished 7. Train your staff as a team 8. Make sound and timely decisions 9. Develop a sense of responsibility among your staff 10. Employ your staff in accordance with its capabilities 11. Seek responsibility and take responsibility for your actions 1. Justice: Justice is the practice of being fair and consistent. A just person gives consideration to each side of a situation and bases rewards or punishments on merit. As good leaders, we have to hold people accountable. We have to show that if you do good, you get good things. If you do bad, you will be held accountable. 2. Judgment: Often, leaders must assess situations quickly and without significant time to reflect. The Marine Corps refers to the \""70 Percent Solution,\"" meaning an imperfect solution that can be acted upon quickly, rather than waiting for the perfect judgment - which may never come. This guideline doesn't advise acting in extreme haste; rather, it advises avoiding \""analysis Paralysis.\"" It argues that with 70 percent of the possible knowledge, having completed 70 percent of the analysis, and with a confidence rate of about 70 percent, the time is right to make an informed judgment. 3. Dependability: Amidst the stress and chaos of combat, there often is no telling how people will react. A hero one day may be a catatonic wreck the next. Some would say that's perfectly understandable. Marines say that's totally unacceptable. Marines demand dependability in all situations - on and off the battlefield. Leaders have consistency in crisis and do not over commit. They do what they say they'll do when they say they'll do it. 4. Initiative: Find a way to take the initiative; don't do it for the recognition or for the glory, do it to help accomplish the mission. </p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">Who are you? Tell us about yourself in 300 words or less.</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">As I've crisscrossed Central Texas, I have learned a lot about what makes us great--and what needs to be fixed. The most defining quality I've seen is our common desire to leave Texas and our country a better place for our children and generations to come. We all care about our families and our own lives. And that translates into concerns about schools, safety, roads, health care and jobs.

I share these concerns too and decided to participate in our great democracy by running for Congress. For more than a decade, I've called Central Texas home. My three children grew up attending Round Rock Public Schools, and my oldest now attends Baylor University.

Over my lifetime, I've developed the skills and collected the life experiences to qualify as your congressman. I'm a software engineer and project manager. I have spent more than 35 years in evidence-based problem solving in complex environments, as well as brokering consensus among diverse groups of stakeholders. I currently work as a project manager providing advice and expertise to clients from around the world.

I now want to work on behalf of the people of Congressional District TX17. It's time for new representation in Congress--leaders who respect the viewpoints of all their constituents, leaders who will put loyalty to the country, the Constitution, and their constituents ahead of PACs, parties, and presidents.</p>
			</div>
						    <div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Please list below 3 key messages of your campaign. What are the main points you want voters to remember about your goals for your time in office?</p>
				<ul class=""key-messages"">
					<li>I support creating a public option to make Medicare available to all who want it.  A public option will:   *Achieve universal coverage - especially important in rural areas where the uninsured rate is high.   * Address uncompensated care for hospitals, a significant contributor to rural hospital closures.    *NOT eliminate private insurance. If you are happy with your employer sponsored insurance, you won't be forced to give it up    *Preserve the protections for those with preexisting conditions achieved under the ACA    *Provide relief from medical bill-induced bankruptcy - the leading cause of US personal bankruptcy.    *Empower Medicare to negotiate prescription drug prices.  A public option is a practical, achievable next step.</li>
					<li>I advocate a comprehensive revision of our immigration system that both meets our economic and security needs and reflects our values as a society. The pillars of such a plan:  *​Treat all asylum seekers with basic human dignity and respect and process their claims in a timely manner   * Secure our borders and ports of entry with a portfolio of technology and human resource based solutions   * Emphasize interior enforcement through mandatory pre-hiring E-Verify checks and prosecution of employers who fail to comply    * A path to citizenship for many of our 10.5 million undocumented residents who have lived among us for more than a decade, that focuses on security and brings them fully into the fold of our communities.     </li>
					<li>The time to argue over the validity of climate change is over. The time to act is now.  As your Congressman, I would support a carbon dividend and fee policy similar to the one proposed by the Climate Leadership Council. Such a plan would provide market incentives to businesses and individuals to reduce carbon emissions and provide funding for research into clean energy alternatives - research that will lead to technology improvements that would make clean energy production more economically feasible right here in Central Texas.</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
							<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What areas of public policy are you personally passionate about?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">We have to tackle some of the structural problems that have contributed to the extreme divisiveness in Congress with legislative action. I support H.R. 1 - the We the People Act of 2019 which would:

</p><ul><li>Expand voter registration and access</li></ul>
 *Improve election security
 *Establish an alternative campaign funding system the includes federal matching of small contributions
 *Tighten ethics standards for all three branches of government
 *Reduce or eliminate gerrymandering (most important, in my opinion) by requiring states to establish independent, nonpartisan redistricting commissions

​I know that it will take a lot more than these first steps to ease our current polarization. But if we don't start this long journey with a few small steps now, we'll never get there.<p></p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">What would be your top three priorities, if elected?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">First-thing, first-day is campaign finance reform. Faith in our democracy is at an all-time low, and a lot of that is because people feel like their voice is being drowned out by big corporate donors. We must stop big money in politics. As long as corporations are considered people, we will never get Congress to do what needs to be done for Alaskans. I have pledged to not take a time from corporate PAC's. So I will not only be Alaska's first Congresswoman, but the first Alaskan member of Congress who will have the ability to turn away lobbyists, because I'm not in anyone's pocket.  My first action in Congress will be to sign the DISCLOSE Act â€” which requires more transparency and accountability in politics. There are 106 other House candidates running in close elections who have pledged to sign this law. Together, we can clear the way for Congress to do the people's business.

Another priority is to fix our broken healthcare system. Alaska has the highest healthcare costs in the world per capita, which is harming our economy. Wages aren't growing, and small businesses are hurting. Unlike my opponent Don Young, I have a plan for improving healthcare. Don Young has voted 56 times to strip healthcare coverage from Alaskans, including people with preexisting conditions and the 41,000 Alaskans who get their coverage through Medicaid expansion. I support common sense solutions to our healthcare costs, such as: (1) requiring Medicare to negotiate with Big Pharma; (2) allowing pharmacies to safely import drugs from Canada and Europe where pharmaceuticals cost less than they do here; (3) amending our laws to allow small-population states to sell health insurance across state lines in order to grow Alaska's risk pool; and (4) offering Alaskans the ability to buy into successful comprehensive healthcare programs â€” something like the NUKA model here in Alaska, which already provides quality care for Alaska Natives and vets at half the cost of private health plans in our state.

Lastly, our policy-makers need to recognize that Social Security and Medicare are earned benefits for seniors and elders that have been paid for, earned, and promised after a lifetime of hard work.

Don Young and his colleagues in Washington support cutting Social Security and Medicare in order to pay for their irresponsible tax cut bill which added $1.4 trillion to the deficit. I'm not opposed to cutting taxes, but it must be done in a way that prioritizes working families over billionaires, and cannot be paid for by cutting earned benefits. In Congress, I will fight to protect Social Security and Medicare.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What areas of public policy are you personally passionate about?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">For the past five years, I led Great Alaska Schools, a public education advocacy organization that I helped grow from 40 to 4,000 Alaskans. I brought together Democrats, Republicans, Independents, educators, parents, grandparents, and students to hold the line on public education funding for our state. The strength of our economy begins with strong education for all Alaskans. But we aren't doing everything we can at the federal level to invest in our children. Only one-third of our kids are prepared for Kindergarten â€” the national average is twice that. Alaska currently has the lowest public investment in Pre-K. Alaska doesn't get the flexibility it needs to best use federal K-12 education funding. And leaders I've met within Alaska's construction and building trades are worried there won't be enough qualified new workers to offset the workers who are retiring.

Every person in Alaska deserves a first-rate education that helps them realize their potential, seize the opportunity and raise the next great generation of Alaskans. I'm the mom of four kids educated by Alaska public schools. As Alaska's Congresswoman, I will fight for policies that strengthen our education system and drives Alaska's economy to thrive in the future.</p>

				<ul class=""key-messages"">
					<li>Access to quality, affordable health care is a fundamental human right. As a cancer survivor, I know what it's like to receive a life-changing diagnosis and how access to healthcare can be the difference between life and death.</li>
					<li>I will work to bring federal dollars to the district to fix our roads, highways, and bridges. Right here in our backyard, the Brent Spence Bridge and Western Hills Viaduct are crumbling and have been neglected for years. We need a strong leader who will build partnerships at the local, state, and federal level to get the job done. </li>
					<li>Gun violence is a national security and public health issue, and poses unacceptable risks to our kids and families. I take a common-sense approach to reducing gun violence, including mandatory background checks on all gun purchases, banning the sale of military-style weapons, and passing red flag laws to keep guns away from violent criminals.</li>

				<p class=""survey-response"">I always recommend Mountains beyond Mountains by Paul Farmer. At its core, the book is about making the impossible possible and the principle that all lives have equal value. It resonates with me and the work I have pursued in my life. I am especially inspired by its message of how to bring new approaches to address old problems and to build a diverses coalition of stakeholders (patients, clinicians, government leaders, private sector, NGOs, etc.) to solve complex problems. This has been something I have taken to heart in my entire professional career in public health.
</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What characteristics or principles are most important for an elected official?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I feel very strongly that all elected officials must be willing to work with their colleagues regardless of political affiliation to get results for their constituents. We must put people over politics and focus on improving the lives of the people we represent over political gamesmanship. 
</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What qualities do you possess that you believe would make you a successful officeholder?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I have spent my entire career finding solutions to complex problems in public health. As healthcare continues to be a dominant public policy issue, we need more leaders who understand the nuance of public health policy and know how to find workable solutions to these tough problems.
</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What do you believe are the core responsibilities for someone elected to this office?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Bottom line, elected officials have an obligation to help others - to represent all of their constituents, not simply the ones that voted for them. We need more leaders willing to pursue solutions and bring people together as Americans across party and other lines. We must all work with integrity to improve the lives of those in our district and shape public policy that will improve the nation.
</p>

					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What legacy would you like to leave?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">When my time in elected office is over, I would like for my legacy to be that I was a tireless advocate for my community - a problem solver who was unafraid to tackle big issues such as healthcare reform and infrastructure spending.
</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What was your very first job? How long did you have it?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">After graduating from Indiana University, my first job was working as for then Sen. Evan Bayh (IN) for two years. For the first two months, I answered phones in the front office and greeted all the visitors to the offices. I then was promoted to work as a Legislative Correspondent with a focus on health care issues. I was responsible for researching healthcare legislation for the Senator and also drafting responses to constituents who reached out on healthcare issues. As in all jobs, I also took on a bunch of other responsibilities wherever needed/valuable - like giving Capitol tours to visiting constituents, staffing the weekly \""Hoosier Hospitality\"" meet and greet, helping to organize (and reserve field space) for the office softball team, drafting memos with voting recommendations, and coordinating with colleagues in other Senate offices to help refine and advance bills on common priorities. 

I learned a ton working for Senator Bayh - and loved the opportunity to understand how our federal government works. I also developed a deep respect for his thoughtful and values-driven leadership style that put people over politics. At the same time, I was disappointed by the slow pace of results in Congress. I saw firsthand how only a small fraction of the most promising bills each year would advance; the vast majority would never move forward. 

As an action-oriented person, my two years in Congress informed my decision to pursue an MBA, particularly to hone my skills in management, finance and negotiation. I resolved that I would always stay involved in public service in my personal time, but also wanted to pursue a career in healthcare that would allow me to flip between the public and private sectors. I believed (and still do) that there is a lot to learn from both sectors, and especially the intersection of them.

				<p class=""survey-question"">What was the last song that got stuck in your head?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">\""It's Quiet Uptown\"" from the Hamilton Broadway soundtrack. 

It's a beautiful song by Lin-Manuel Miranda about love, loss, marriage and forgiveness... about how we all suffer unimaginable hardship in our lives... and yet find a way through with love. It's my go-to song to calm myself on days when I feel stressed or pulled in too many directions. And I love the message of forgiveness. It reminds me that we are all doing our best and to always give others the benefit of the doubt because you don't know what they are going through.

					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What is something that has been a struggle in your life?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Over Thanksgiving in 2010, I was diagnosed with Hodgkin's Lymphoma. In my early thirties, I felt invincible and on top of the world. To have my life turned upside down so quickly is a feeling of vulnerability I won't ever forget.
In that moment, everything changed. I realized that all my big plans for the future - getting married, starting a family, building my career - weren't in my control any more. And might not be even be possible. I felt helpless. And completely vulnerable. I discovered that the problems I thought were problems the day before were no longer relevant. All that mattered now was two things:

-          Could I access the treatment?
-          And would it work on my body?

I was lucky. I was lucky that I had insurance that allowed me to get the chemo that I needed without risking bankruptcy or lifelong debt. I was lucky to have a job that was flexible to work around chemo sessions. I was lucky to have a network of friends and family whose love and support carried me through this difficult time. And I was especially lucky to be in the percent of patients who responded to treatment.

Now, nine years out, I can happily report that I am cancer-free. And that I got to go back to my big plans after all. John and I got married a year after I finished chemo, and we now have two wonderful children, Josie and Peter, who are 6 and 4 (and who are running around somewhere here).

But I've never forgotten what it feels like to be vulnerable. And that's a huge part of why I'm running. Health care is a human right. It's not okay to play politics with people's lives.</p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">Who are you? Tell us about yourself in 300 words or less.</p>
				<p class=""survey-response""></p><p>Brian Matlock is running for the open Kansas US Senate seat as a Republican Socialist. The current partisan finger-pointing is unproductive and is producing negative results for Kansas towns. There is a lot of overlap between good-neighbor Republicans and common sense Socialists; both groups value showing up, pitching in, and doing what it takes to get the job done.</p><p>Brian wants to cut through the corruption and obstruction within both parties and form a coalition of Kansans who are focused on making our communities better. The campaign will be going from town to town, talking with folks who have been at the losing end of irresponsible financial and political practices. We will be organizing low- to middle-income Kansans against big industry and in favor of big, bold policy change that will revitalize our dying towns.</p><p>Through his proposed Federally Funded Locally Administered Job Guarantee program, local folks will be at the frontlines of deciding how an influx of money should be spent in their communities. We look forward to criss-crossing Kansas over the next several months to get a better idea of what type of projects Kansans would take on if the Federal Government were to invest in their communities.</p><p></p>
			</div>
						    <div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Please list below 3 key messages of your campaign. What are the main points you want voters to remember about your goals for your time in office?</p>
				<ul class=""key-messages"">
					<li><p>When folks in this country are unemployed, it isn't because there isn't enough work to be done. There are endless projects to take on in our communities - dilapidated housing, care work of every type, increasing access to healthy foods - but the money to start these projects always seems just out of reach as our local governments scramble to find money to keep the basic infrastructure in place. Meanwhile, Federal money is being used to shower already wealthy corporations and pay for endless wars. It is time we put that money to work in our communities. A Federally funded, locally administered job guarantee would put the resources in our hands to prioritize the things we need done and build an economy that works for us!</p></li>
					<li><p>We know fossil fuels are finite. We know they lower air and water quality. Plastics have been in wide use for only a single generation and are already piling up around the world and killing our sea life. We know that air and water pollution can lead to any number of negative health effects and can significantly reduce life expectancies in areas where that pollution is concentrated. We don't need a degree in environmental science to know we have to stop passing the buck! We know the only way that a Green New Deal is going to be truly beneficial is if it is written and designed by the low- to middle-income people who are going to be most directly affected by climate change and other environmental factors.</p></li>
					<li><p>Republican Socialism is the movement to revive our dying communities, both urban and rural, by using Federal dollars to fund local, community-driven projects, particularly in low-income areas. It is a movement to unite Kansans who are tired of the status quo. It is about the coalition between good-neighbor Republicans and common-sense Socialists. Both coalitions want to pitch in, take care of each other, and have meaningful work that enriches our lives, rather than jobs with long hours and low wages to further enrich billionaires.</p></li>
				</ul>
			</div>
							<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What areas of public policy are you personally passionate about?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">As a PhD candidate in Economics, Brian leans heavily on systemic fixes to economic problems.  He understands how the United States government creates money, and how that money is then controlled and distributed through the Federal Reserve. His knowledge of Economics allows him to explain exactly how we can pay for the big fixes that we so urgently need, but he also understands the mistrust of big government, and a major emphasis of the campaign centers around Local Control of Federal funds.

Top issues that Brian wants to tackle include the climate crisis and all the underlying issues faced by folks who struggle to pay their bills. Brian knows that a Green New Deal is necessary if we want to avoid a national and global crisis in the coming decades. 

A major part of the Green New Deal is the Federal Job Guarantee. Even though the unemployment rate is currently low, it could and should be much lower - at or near 0. Furthermore, too many folks are underemployed, working in jobs that pay less than a living wage, or working in jobs that don't fit their physical or psychological needs.

Medicare for All is another necessity that Brian will be championing. Healthcare is a right, and it is insane that tens of millions of people are foregoing care because they can't fit it into their budget.

Other issues include Housing for All (housing is also a human right), compassionate Immigration Reform, and a re-envisioning of our prisons and our criminal justice system as a whole.</p>

					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What characteristics or principles are most important for an elected official?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">A proven commitment to serving the people, not themselves.   
Surrounds themselves with good people- we all need help filling in the gaps but while some spend time  with working class Americans and fill their team with those committed to do research and write policies with objectives that will broadly benefit people- not just corporate special interest groups.

</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What qualities do you possess that you believe would make you a successful officeholder?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I am a visionary, big picture, long term thinker.  I have an unusual ability to understand complex systems and come up with bold and innovative solutions. 
I love people.  I have spent my life in service rolls, am not materialistic in the slightest-  I love spending time with average people and am motivated to make the world a better place for them.
I am outside the box.   I make my own way and have no desire to fit in with the herd.  I am just the type of person who is going to shake things up in Washington.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What was your very first job? How long did you have it?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">My first side-hustle was mowing lawns for my grandma and one of her friends throughout high school.  My first formal job was at the Yogurt Affaire in Nampa Idaho.  I made $5.15/hr and worked there for about 5 months.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What is something that has been a struggle in your life?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">My wife went through stage 3 rectal cancer when we were still relatively newly married.   We had insurance the entire time, but after a year of  treatment we were more than 50$K dollars in debt and had to declare medical bankruptcy.   Almost immediately after my wife finished treatments we started fostering our now adopted daughter.   It was a period of time that totally tore apart all plans I had for myself and only in the last year have I felt able to dream and plan for the future again in the way that I did before that year.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What do you perceive to be the United States’ greatest challenges as a nation over the next decade?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Rising healthcare, housing, and education costs for 40 years while wages have remained stagnant.  Additionally, we are depending on fossil fuels which are finite, make are air and water quality worse, and even though plastic has only been around for a single generation it is piling up around the world.   We need to address these core economic and environmental issues as well as the fact that the vast majority of politicians are unwilling to do anything other that put band-aids on the problems.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">If you are not a current senator, are there certain committees that you would want to be a part of?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Given my economics background I would be most excited about being on the Budget or Finance committees or continuing the legacy of Roberts of representing Kansas on the Agriculture committee.</p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">Who are you? Tell us about yourself in 300 words or less.</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I'm the America First grassroots candidate running to end illegal immigration, protect the 2nd Amendment and drain the corrupt D.C. swamp. I grew up in California where I saw liberal policies and illegal immigration destroy the state. I worked in Washington, D.C. during the Obama years and saw the absolute corruption that controls our government. Now I'm raising my family in Oregon and fighting for our future in this great State and Country. My campaign has been focused on constituent engagement and getting in touch with the voters that have been forgotten in our district. Working Oregonians are tired of the corruption. Let's win!</p>

					<li>I'm Fighting for Oregon to end illegal immigration and always place the American citizen first in every piece of legislation. We can build the wall, mandate e-verify and deport illegal aliens!</li>
					<li>Our 2nd Amendment is under attack. I'll be your Federal Friend in D.C.  where I'll push federal preemption on any state gun bans, mag size limits or other infringements. I'll also push for constitutional carry!</li>

							<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What areas of public policy are you personally passionate about?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Immigration
Americans deserve a safe Country with strong borders and enforced laws. It's common sense!
We must repair broken immigration laws to benefit our country and citizens. America 1st!
Businesses must follow the law just like American citizens. Require e-verify and legal employment!
Stop business as usual in D.C. by prioritizing the American worker and family. I'll be your voice!

America First Economy
American capitalism has lifted generations out of poverty. Keep the marketplace free and fair!
Cut the red tape and regulations that hurt so many small businesses and job growth. Lower all taxes!
Stop taxpayer funded bailouts and let the marketplace work. Reject socialist programs!
Require government infrastructure projects to hire and buy American. Spend our tax dollars locally!

End Government Corruption
D.C. is filled with career politicians who only work together to deficit spend. We can stop it together!
We see politicians being cozy with special interests. I won't be. I'll always be true to Oregonians!
The federal government has forgotten they serve the American people. We need open accountability!
We need to cut foreign spending, audit the Fed and pass single budgets for agencies. Drain the swamp!

Protecting the Unborn
Get the American taxpayer out of funding the abortion industry. No public dollars for abortion!
Co-sponsor the 20 week pain capable bill that acknowledges the life of an unborn child. Pass it!

				<p class=""survey-question"">Who are you? Tell us about yourself in 300 words or less.</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I am Dr. Johnny Teague. I am running for Congress against Al Green to represent the 9th Congressional District.  I am a preacher, author of 3 books, small business owner, cattle rancher, hunter, and happily married man to my beautiful wife Lori. We have 2 daughters, Brittany and Kate. I work with the local schools, hospitals, home owners association in caring for the needs in this community.  I have been to all 50 states, 18 countries, and have five college degrees - 2 Bachelors, 2 Masters, and a Doctorate.  Because I am worried about what is happening to America, I am determined to fight for the freedoms and principles our nation was founded on. I support the movement in our nation to protect Americans and to restore all that we have lost. My desire is to go to Washington and help accomplish that task. Our Representatives should be servants of the people fighting for what is best for them, not seeking gain for themselves. That is why I am for 8 year term limits on members of Congress, reduce our debt, and return to our Biblical, traditional values.

					<li>We need term limits. We need to get out of debt. We need to return to our traditional, Constitutional, Biblical values.  </li>
					<li>I am totally against Sanctuary Cities as they are in violation of the Law.  I believe we need to secure the borders and then deal with immigration - in that order period.  We have laws for immigration.  I would not reform them, but enforce them.  </li>
					<li>I strongly support the Second Amendment. I believe we need to enforce the laws we have. Removing guns is not the answer.  Criminals will never turn in theirs.  </li>
				</ul>
			</div>
							<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What areas of public policy are you personally passionate about?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I believe that more than anything, our nation has to get back to what is right and righteous.  There is a way that seems right to man but, in the end, leads to destruction.  I will fight to protect our Constitution and rights given to us by our Founding Fathers.  I believe in term limits with Congressmen who serve their constituents not work to increase their own wealth, and who will stand strong for what is right.  Our President has shown this resilience and this is what has made him so effective.  I have the same determination, but I also have the communication skills to compel and persuade others. 

I believe the best thing the government can do is to get out of the way and let our free enterprise system run its course.  The beauty of our system is that it is self-corrective.  I would not increase taxes.  I do believe we need a steady, orchestrated cut over the next ten years in every entitlement but Social Security and Medicare, but develop a system that will separate those two funds from all others, guard them, and find ways to help them be sustainable.  

The greatest calling of the federal government, in my opinion, is to keep us safe.  I am totally against Sanctuary Cities as they are in violation of the Law.  I believe we need to secure the borders and then deal with immigration - in that order period.  We have laws for immigration.  I would not reform them, but enforce them.  

I strongly support the Second Amendment.  Criminals will never turn in their guns.</p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">Who do you look up to? Whose example would you like to follow, and why?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I would love to model myself after William McKinley or Dwight D. Eisenhower - in their faith, in their righteousness,  in their leadership, and in their ability to stand firm and bring opposition to the right side of the issues.  </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What characteristics or principles are most important for an elected official?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I believe we need a Congressman who is for term limits, who wants to serve the constituents, keep their day job, and is unwilling to back down on what is right.  He need to possess strong moral character. There is a way that seems right to man but, in the end, leads to destruction</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What qualities do you possess that you believe would make you a successful officeholder?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">This is my believe there are no perfect public officials &amp; there never will be.  God, family, &amp; country are still where my priorities &amp; zeal in life reside.  Leadership - this has to be in all matters.  Leadership requires hard choices.  Our nation must be one whose officials give the nation what it needs over what it wants.  Cut backs must occur.  

People must go back to work, leaning less on the government &amp; more on their industry.  God still holds this position as the Giver of all good things. He is the One who says if we don't work, we don't eat.  Kennedy said, \""Ask what we can do for our country\"".  Reagan said the scariest thing a person can face is to meet a guy at the front door who says, \""I am from the government &amp; am here to help you.\"".

I believe that our government officials should come from the people &amp; return to the people after a period of service.  We call this term-limits which should apply to every level, not just the President.  Harry Truman left office moderately poor &amp; refused to use that office to make money during or after serving.   We call this service, not for our own selfish good, but for the good of the nation.

We don't dictate what is right or wrong. God does that.  If someone disagrees with our stand, it is not us they should argue with, but with God. But, as people defy what God says, they soon find that the way they have chosen doesn't work.  The reason God makes commands &amp; gives requirements on how to live is that those ways are best for us &amp; best for others.  We cannot pick &amp; choose the things God has said &amp; think we will come out alright, or vainly imagine that we know better than God with regard to our time &amp; our generation.  God's Word is timeless. Right will always be right.  Wrong will always be wrong.  Our Constitution's number one source was the Bible.  

Too many laws weigh down &amp; too few laws make it dangerous to leave home. Taking something that is wrong &amp; making it legal isn't good administration or enforcement.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What is your favorite book? Why?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">My favorite book is the Bible.  It contains the answers we need to obtain the best life we can achieve on this earth.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What do you perceive to be the United States’ greatest challenges as a nation over the next decade?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">The greatest challenges as a nation we face is implosion.  We no longer seek what is right.  Everyone does what is right in their own eyes.  There is no love of country, no willingness to do what is best for our nation in its standing among the nations of the world.  We need to return to the willingness to do right for the good of all men - sacrifice, integrity, and honor.  John  Adams said our form of government is only suitable for a moral and religious people, it is inadequate for any other. 

We need to decrease government spending and reduce our out of control  debt.  I believe the best thing the government can do is to get out of the way and let our free enterprise system run its course.  The beauty of our system is that it is self-corrective.  I would not increase taxes.  I would love to see us do something with regard to property taxes.  I do believe we need a steady, orchestrated cut over the next ten years in every entitlement but Social Security and Medicare, but develop a system that will separate those two funds from all other, guard them, and find ways to help them be sustainable.  

I am totally against Sanctuary Cities as they are in violation of the Law.  I believe we need to secure the borders and then deal with immigration - in that order period.  We have laws for immigration.  I would not reform them, but enforce them.  We should  absolutely build the wall. The greatest calling of the federal government, in my opinion, is to keep us safe.  

I would remove the  Affordable Health Care Act. We need to lift state restrictions and make our system more competitive.  I do believe some of our urgent care businesses are popping up, showing that free enterprise can reduce costs.  I also believe liability and lawsuit fishing is hurting the entire cost structure.  


I strongly support the Second Amendment but I do want to be sure that where there is a danger, we deal with it.  Removing guns is not the answer.  Criminals will never turn in theirs.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Do you believe that two years is the right term length for representatives?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">We need term limits.  A 2 years term is enough time for people to see how well there representatives are working on their behalf.  I also believe in a 8 year term limit on our Congressmen and Senators just as we have on people who become president. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Is there a particular representative, past or present, whom you want to model yourself after?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">If they are holding the representative that I would most like to emulate, to the United States  House of Representatives. I would say John Quincy Adams. Because he stood against slavery when everyone else seemed to be far it. He was even forced to be silent because they were tired of hearing him speak about correcting  an issue that was wrong. Because John Quincy Adams would not be silent, he ultimately won the day.

I would also love to model myself after William McKinley or Dwight D. Eisenhower - in their faith, in their righteousness,  in their leadership, and in their ability to stand firm and bring opposition to the right side of the issues.  </p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">Please list below 3 key messages of your campaign. What are the main points you want voters to remember about your goals for your time in office?</p>
				<ul class=""key-messages"">
					<li>Healthcare is a human right. Medicare for All is the only solution that ensures a focus on healthcare and not private industry profit.</li>
					<li>Green New Deal: We have to address climate change with solutions that match the magnitude of the crises we face. The GND will also help create jobs in renewable energy.</li>
					<li>As an advocate for the people of Maine for nearly 40 years, I know what it takes to fight for what matters.</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
							<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What areas of public policy are you personally passionate about?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Medicare for all. Everybody in, nobody out.
Medicare for All means we:
- Guarantee quality healthcare to every American
- Reorganize our healthcare system to provide coverage for mental health care, dental care, eye care and hearing aids.
- Pay caregivers in and outside of the home a living wage
- Lower the cost of prescription drugs by requiring price negotiation

The Green New Deal will be America's biggest and most transformative initiative since our national mobilization for World War II. It calls for a fundamental restructuring of our nation's priorities.
- Enacting a 10-year plan that leads to the United States operating on 100% clean and renewable energy
- Ending the $20 billion American taxpayers give to the fossil fuel industry annually
- Providing training for fossil fuel-industry workers to transition to a clean-energy economy
- Rejoining the Paris Climate Agreement
- Investing in our roads, bridges and transportation infrastructures

Getting money out of politics is the first and most ambitious step to reclaim our electoral system. We must end Citizens United. Betsy has also proposed enacting a small-dollar based clean elections system on the federal level. It is also time to implement a to a 12-week campaign cycle.

Education - 
-Eliminate student debt. 
-Universal pre-k and affordable childcare
-Debt-free higher education, including vocational schooling
-Paying teachers a livable wage

				<p class=""survey-question"">Who are you? Tell us about yourself in 300 words or less.</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Rosemary is a leading tax policy lawyer and consultant who works as a Strategic Advisor and Counsel at Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck, where she specializes in tax and financial services matters. Rosemary began her career in the public sector at the IRS as an attorney and advisor before moving on to the majority staff of the U.S. Senate Finance Committee as tax counsel. It was during her time on the Finance Committee that Rosemary co-authored the ""529 college savings plans,"" that are used today by parents across the country to help their children pay for college. She has also held in-house executive positions, including as vice president of federal government relations at Citigroup and Fidelity Investments.

Rosemary also has been a political advocate both on the national and local level. She has authored multiple commentary pieces on tax and financial services issues. She has served in a leadership role of the Tax Coalition, including serving as the chair. Most recently, Rosemary was Chairman of the Board of Running Start, an organization dedicated to getting more women elected to public office. Rosemary is also the New Jersey Chair for Maggie's List.

As a result of seeing the harm inflicted on families and businesses from high taxes and uncontrolled government spending, Rosemary started Jersey First, a non-profit organization with the mission to educate and advocate for policy solutions to lower taxes, reduce government spending and help put New Jersey's economy back on track.

While Rosemary has achieved a highly successful professional career, her family has always been her priority. Rosemary often is found at her daughters' hockey games, driving to dance, or preparing for her families' (including her sister, brother, niece and nephews) weekly Sunday dinner. Rosemary lives in Short Hills with her husband, Scott and their three daughters.

						    <div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Please list below 3 key messages of your campaign. What are the main points you want voters to remember about your goals for your time in office?</p>
				<ul class=""key-messages"">
					<li>1.	Debt, Deficit, &amp; Taxes: In New Jersey, the state's fiscal problems are among the worst of all 50 states. Yet the Governor and Legislature have adopted a record-spending budget, increased spending by $4 Billion over two years and continues to raise taxes. We need to end government's addiction to deficit spending and raising taxes. The reckless cycle of raising and spending tax dollars has made New Jersey unaffordable and, on the national level, put our national security at risk - because a nation heavily indebted to the rest of the world will become economically unstable, and an unstable economy will lead to collapse. It is far past time for government to get responsible.</li>
					<li>2.	Immigration: Congress has completely abandoned its responsibility to fix our broken immigration system. We need to secure our borders, while also being compassionate towards those who have worked hard and established families in the United States. But compassion is not an excuse for failing to protect our national sovereignty, identify who is entering our nation, deal with visa overstays and streamline the citizenship process. The misguided and reckless declaration of sanctuary states and cities is a direct result of Congressional inaction, and it only serves to make our communities unsafe and complicate societal problems.</li>
					<li>3.	Healthcare: We need to preserve coverage for pre-existing conditions and provide access to quality health care for everyone, including the elderly and those amongst us with disabilities. The current health care system is too expensive and unsustainable. Medicare for all is a proposal that will short change our seniors, doubling our taxes and bankrupting our nation. We need to eliminate the barriers for more competition in the health care market and provide families access to the care and types of policies that fit their needs, not a one-size-fits all model. We also need to make health care costs transparent and remove the prospect of expensive surprise medical billing.</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
							<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What areas of public policy are you personally passionate about?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">The data is clear. Our students are leaving the state for college and not returning to New Jersey. Businesses are leaving New Jersey because the tax burden is too high. Families are leaving because they simply can't afford to live here any longer. While many of the causes are driven by state policies, Garden State taxpayers are sending far more dollars to Washington than we are getting in return with federal investments - and that must end. Issue by issue, we must look at what is in the best interests of the people of New Jersey and what policies will promote a future where people can make their version of the American dream work here in New Jersey.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What are your thoughts on term limits?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">If people in Congress knew they had a set time to actually get something done in Washington, they would not go down there trying to be something. They would have to actually accomplish the things that voters elected them to do rather than build a career in politics. I proudly support a Constitutional Amendment that would limit members of Congress to three House terms and two Senate terms. </p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">What would be your top three priorities, if elected?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">The primary issues that compelled me to run are economic insecurity, climate disruption and human rights. These three are linked together for me, particularly living in a ""fossil fuel state"" that currently relies heavily on fossil fuels for our economic stability. We need people in DC who will both see the realities of climate disruption unflinchingly AND craft policy that ensures people's economic needs are met.  I believe, like a handful of others currently in office, that economic rights are human rights. I also believe that our current immigrant human rights violations have their roots in climate migration among other issues that are bringing people here. We must adopt the stance that we are all in this together and work for a collective solution to our economic woes, human rights crisis and climate crisis as one package.  I also believe firmly that blunting big corporations' power and empowering local communities to develop their own locally-appropriate economic answers is a critical cornerstone to the way forward for Wyoming and the US.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What areas of public policy are you personally passionate about?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I have a number of interests in policy development. My passions include:

Healthcare: I propose a universal healthcare guarantee (which needs to include abortion on demand, birth control, mental health services, and full funding of the Veteran's Administration healthcare system). I further favor the deprivatization of health insurance and pharmaceuticals. Finally, marijuana needs to be legalized, people incarcerated for marijuana convictions need to be released and their records for those ""offenses"" wiped.

Ecological Stability: We need to pass and flesh out the Green New Deal, with special attention on fossil fuel states making the transition in a positive way for our communities, and the bipartisan Carbon Fee and Dividend bill. We also need to restore our basic ecological protections that are being eroded under the Trump administration, and strengthen our system of public lands at all levels of public ownership.

Economic Insecurity: with almost half of Americans unable to afford a $400 emergency, we are at a crisis point economically, and I do not believe that our continued rush toward privatization and trying to make capitalism nicer is going to cut it. I am a socialist who focuses on local empowerment (in the form of strong unions and worker-owned cooperatives), state control (in the form of public utilities such as public banks and pharmaceutical entities) and limiting the role of the federal government to things that truly make sense to collectivize at that level, including healthcare, environmental protections and human rights guarantees.

Human rights: We need increased and restored protections for immigrants, the LGBTQIA community, the incarcerated, and people of all religions and none. I favor reparations and the restoration of serious consideration of treaty rights with our Indigenous populations. We also need to look seriously at police reform and the high rates of people of color shot every year by law enforcement, rarely with any consequences for the police. Any conversations we have about gun control I believe need to happen within the context of police reform, and with respect for basic Second Amendment rights.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Who do you look up to? Whose example would you like to follow, and why?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">My candidacy would not be possible were it not for the work in DC of Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and others who have pushed strongly for serious economic reform.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Is there a book, essay, film, or something else you would recommend to someone who wants to understand your political philosophy?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">My own 2017 book (published under the name Ma'ikwe Ludwig) ""Together Resilient: Building Community in the Age of Climate Disruption"" includes a chapter of legal and economic reform that goes into more depth that we can do here. I also highly recommend two books by Naomi Klein, ""The Shock Doctrine"" and ""This Changes Everything"".</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What characteristics or principles are most important for an elected official?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Having experiences similar to those of their constituents. I don't believe millionaires are very well suited to crafting economic policies that work for most of us, for instance.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What qualities do you possess that you believe would make you a successful officeholder?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I'm a community builder, and I listen for a living as a professional facilitator. Even if I disagree with some of the people I will be representing (and I will; it is impossible to agree with everyone all the time about everything) I believe public officials are obligated to make a good faith effort to understand the people they are there to represent. I have deep practice in this. 

I have also lived in contexts that were geared toward ecological and economic justice and believe I have a unique perspective on what is possible.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What do you believe are the core responsibilities for someone elected to this office?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">#1: Listening. #2: setting aside personal agendas to be able to legislate for the good of the people.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What legacy would you like to leave?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I would like to help turn the ship in the direction of a post-carbon, economically and racially just country. I would also, if elected, be the first woman and first out queer person to represent Wyoming, and while I don't think that alone is a reason to run (or for anyone to vote for me) I do think representation matters, and I'd be delighted to be the first in both of those areas.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What was your very first job? How long did you have it?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">One of my early jobs was as the Director of a community gardens organization. It is still one of my favorite jobs that I have had because it was so concrete in the service it provided to people. I also cut my teeth as an educator and nonprofit professional, and it was all very exciting and new.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What is your favorite holiday? Why?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Thanksgiving! It's all about food and community. And lately it has been a good opportunity to also start having serious conversations about US history in relation to the Indigenous people who were here before my people.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What is your favorite book? Why?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">How does one pick a favorite book? There are so many...</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What is something that has been a struggle in your life?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I spent 3 years of my life very, very sick with chronic Lyme disease. I still have it, but it is largely in remission. One of the key things that I learned in those years is how to separate my sense of worthiness from my ability to produce economic value. Getting sick like that and literally not being able to do anything for long stretches was a huge blow to my self-esteem, and it wasn't until I started to climb out of the worst of it that I was able to start analyzing it, and wondering why our culture teaches us that we are worthless if we can't make money.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Do you believe that it’s beneficial for senators to have previous experience in government or politics?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Not necessarily. I think any new job is going to have a big learning curve, and being able to hit the ground running is always good. But there are so many paths that we can be on professionally that bring useful experience with them, and I think having a diversity of backgrounds overall is probably the most important thing to having a really good, functional Senate. 

I've spent 30 years in the nonprofit and social change sectors, and they have instilled in me some very strong problem solving skills, as well as deep compassion for real people's real lives, that I wouldn't trade for a long political career. I've also stocked grocery shelves and scrubbed toilets to get by. Those experiences mean that I get some very fundamental things about those of us who are called ""ordinary"" people in often derisive terms. I'm going to bring that with me as well.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What criteria would you apply when deciding whether to confirm presidential appointees?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">This is an incredibly important role the Senate plays. Questions I would ask:
1) Is the person qualified in terms of having experience (direct or indirect) that I think will add up to being competent in the work?
2) Do they have fundamental respect for the job they will be fulfilling?
3) Do they seem to have a firm and reality-based handle on the challenges of our moment that their job will touch? 
4) Do they seem to fundamentally care about the people their work is intended to serve?</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">If you are not a current senator, are there certain committees that you would want to be a part of?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Honestly I feel like my interests cut across a lot of lines, and I think I could be happy serving in any number of places in the committee structure. A few of potential specific interest to me are:
Environment and Public Works
Energy and Natural Resources
Commerce, Science and Transportation
Health, Education, Labor and Pensions
Indian Affairs
Finance</p>

Virginia is the front line against the Socialist agenda to dismantle our country. and that is why I am entering the fight.

Our District needs more trade jobs. The people also need more options for private health insurance, through competitive markets. We need our Congressional Representative to help funnel alleviation from heavy burdensome regulations that do nothing for them, and make it even harder to make ends meet in a Democratic New York. </p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">Who are you? Tell us about yourself in 300 words or less.</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Matt Rains is a 5th Generation Montanan and grew-up on the Birdtail Ranch in Simms training and showing Quarter Horses.   He attended the U.S. Military Academy at West Point and graduated in 2002. He served seven years active duty as a Blackhawk Helicopter pilot and officer in the US, South Korea, and Iraq with a rank of Captain.   Upon transitioning out of the Army, he became a humanitarian photographer traveling almost 60 countries while doing documentaries in Kenya, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Myanmar. His last photographic documentary was on the Rohingya Genocide and Matt was the first foreign photographer to capture remote Rohingya camps at the onset of attacks in 2012. He participated in galleries in Los Angeles and Jeddah to both show his work and discuss the living conditions of the Rohingya people.  In early 2014, Matt became a power plant engineer for Dynegy in St. Louis. His principle role was major outage inspections of which he covered both coal and gas plants as the company grew from 23 to over 50 plants in four years. During this time, he developed one of the country's first UAV (drone) Utility inspection programs which saved the company over $2M in two years.  Matt received his MBA from Washington University's Olin Business School (St. Louis).  Currently, Matt manages the family ranch in Simms as a horse trainer, horse breeder, and cattleman. His principle aim is to develop top quality performance Quarter Horses versatile to work on ranches, barrel racing, team roping, and AQHA competitions. Birdtail Ranch horses have always been used from 4-H classes to AQHA World Champion competitors and winners.   Matt is running for Congress because a Representative from Montana should represent the majority of our residents. With a background in Agriculture, Military, Humanitarian Documentaries, and Energy, Matt can stand up for Montanans with true been-in-your-shoes experience. </p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">Please list below 3 key messages of your campaign. What are the main points you want voters to remember about your goals for your time in office?</p>
				<ul class=""key-messages"">
					<li>With a background in Agriculture, Military, and Energy, Matt Rains is able to represent the greatest spectrum of Montanans from first-hand experience. </li>
					<li>Jobs and Healthcare are the leading concerns for all Montanans and our families. Whether in Agriculture, Unions, Energy, or a minimum wage earner, Matt will fight endlessly to ensure our futures are prosperous, safe, and healthy.</li>
					<li>Montana deserves dedication. With only one US House Representative, we can not afford to have the position rotated through every election. Matt is dedicated to become our Representative and be on the ballot every following cycle. That dedication will go into his work-ethic both working in Congress in a non-partisan manner and returning back to Montana as often as possible to continue to hear from those he Represents.</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
							<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What areas of public policy are you personally passionate about?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I am personally passionate about Jobs, Healthcare, and Education. ||Jobs in Montana rely on our greatest industry and that is Agriculture.  Traditional Wheat farming and cattle ranching to new emerging opportunities in Industrial Hemp production and processing support our rural communities across the state and are the lifeblood of the Montana way of life. We need these staples to keep all supporting business flourishing. Additionally, Montana must lead the charge to bring more remote positions from Fortune 500 companies to Montana. Big City Remote Salaries should be available to all in Montana from our larger cities to our rural towns.||Healthcare affects each and every Montanan in some way. From newborn to elder, Montanans should not fear or avoid proper healthcare from concern for hospital bills. We should not be burdened by enormous hospital and prescription costs. Additionally, rural Montana must have adequate healthcare available without dependent on potentially life-threatening distances to the next hospital. ||As a small town Montana school product, I know the value and quality of our school system. However, an investment in education is an investment with generational returns. We must ensure our teachers, staff, and schools are given salaries and materials worthy of the responsibility they carry educating our children. From Daycare to College, we must always look for ways to help our youth succeed.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What qualities do you possess that you believe would make you a successful officeholder?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">The greatest quality I possess to be a successful Representative is my breadth of experience in a variety of occupations which allows me to represent Montanans first-hand and not from the sidelines. My Agriculture, Military, and Energy are the three key sectors of our state. Also, my West Point leadership training and military service as an officer gives me a strong foundation to keep our state on the right path moving forward and ensuring those which I serve are not ignored. My strength and determination will help give our lone seat in Congress more emphasis instead of falling in line with party platforms. I will always do what is best for Montana.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What do you believe are the core responsibilities for someone elected to this office?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">The core responsibility for a U.S. House of Representatives Congressman or Congresswoman is to speak for the people in their district. Originally, the Senate was designed to handle long-term nation building legislation. Senators were given six-year terms to give them the freedom to act without influence from mass emotions. On the other hand, the House was designed to take the voice of the people and condense it down to a select few to speak for them. As both the House and Senate are entwined, a balance between the two should, in theory, be accomplished. ||I am running to Represent the people of Montana because I believe I have a fair voice with experience from across many occupations of our state. I have small town, 5th generation roots to Montana. My West Point leadership training and military service in war guides me to focus on what is right. My Agriculture background ties me to Montana's greatest industry as a fellow rancher. Public Lands are essential to keep our state majestic. I am often out riding horses or exploring our public lands and will ensure they are available for generations to come. My four years as an energy sector engineer allows me to help guide our state and country toward a path to add more renewable resources to base-load responsibilities as we reduce our fossil fuel footprint. I sought my MBA from Washington University (Olin Business School) as a top 15 Business school. ||I have always believed a Representative should have a vast background of experience to truly represent those which elect them. Again, a Congressman or Congresswoman's core responsibility is to speak for those they Represent. They must have a voice that is authentic, experienced, and true to those who elect them.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What is the first historical event that happened in your lifetime that you remember? How old were you at the time?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">9/11 happened when I was a junior at West Point and 21 at the time. The countless emotions myself and classmates all felt. Watching the chaos on TV. A lot of my classmates were from New York and had family or friends that worked in the buildings. After the first wave shock passed, my entire class understood that we were the next set of leaders to join the Army in a fight we didn't yet know who we would be fighting. ||I truly feel that our country should never forget or let the memory of September 11, 2001 fade as it was a time that changed the fabric across the country and in most cases made it much stronger. The unity in the aftermath was incredible. The country survived and recovered after those attacks because we found a common voice. ||I am running for Congress because I believe the more willing to strive for a similar common voice will eventually find that voice is loud enough to be heard. We should not require a disaster to force us to unify. My goal is to work toward unifying across the country on our own terms and for the best interest of the entire country.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What was the last song that got stuck in your head?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I was listening to Garth Brooks on his Sirius station and I think he said it right. When you went to a George Strait concert, almost every song you heard seemed like it was your favorite. I would say any song from Garth, George, or Reba could get stuck in my head after about 5 seconds. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What do you perceive to be the United States’ greatest challenges as a nation over the next decade?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">The United States' greatest challenges as a nation over the next decade will be updating our Healthcare system, Infrastructure rebuilding, and Energy reliance. ||The United States significantly lags all developed and leading countries in providing affordable quality care to all citizens. We have a duty to every American to revamp the Healthcare system so a single hospital visit - for any reason - will not significantly affect their financial situation. Currently, the high insurance premiums or danger of only being able to afford a high deductible causes many Americans to live in fear. ||The United States must accelerate our infrastructure maintenance with proper investment for expansion. Preventive maintenance will save the country billions in costs from emergency repairs - especially for bridges and over-passes. ||Energy reliance on fossil fuels must be methodically transitioned toward renewable resources. However, we must ensure complete coverage of extreme weather scenarios before we can confidently place base load requirements fully on renewable power. Additionally, renewable solutions much be held accountable to produce and distribute energy across the grid at total cost similar to current price-per-kilowatt rates. Our challenge is to achieve such rates.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Do you believe that two years is the right term length for representatives?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Specifically to Montana, two years is not a functional term length for a Representative. Unlike many Representatives who cover small geographical areas, a Montana Congressional candidate must campaign across the entire state like a senator. Additionally, Montana's lone seat has recently been used more often as a career hop and not given the weight such a position deserves with Representatives not seeking re-election. Finally, a Representative essentially is always campaigning. A Congressman or Congresswoman should have a period of time they can focus on developing, submitting, promoting, and passing legislation tailored to their state. Although not an advocate for changing the current term limit, I do believe two years for an At Large Representative is a hinderance on their ability to represent their entire state properly.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Is there a particular representative, past or present, whom you want to model yourself after?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I believe the 'Greatest Generation' evolved from multiple cultural influences, but none greater than the effect of both WWI and WWII. In a time when rural communities were much more dominate than todays metropolises and suburbs, military veterans that returned were held on a pedestal because they had experienced more in a  few years than most do in an entire lifetime. They had carried enormous responsibility. They knew what it took to defend the country their families called home. ||In today's age, I believe the impact of military service on one chosen to serve in politics is priceless. I look up to Representatives like Seth Moulton, Jared Golden, Jason Crow, and Tulsi Gabbard. The word 'bipartisan' repeatedly appears through all their legislation in Congress. It is not a coincidence. Today's military veterans in Congress know how to work as a team and bring the best out of an organization. When Congress is the organization, our veteran Representatives are vital to stop the in-house fighting and offer true leadership by providing purpose, direction, and motivation to achieve positive legislation for the United States of America.</p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">Who are you? Tell us about yourself in 300 words or less.</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Weir, is from Olathe, KS and is the former President &amp; C.E.O. of the National Down Syndrome Society (NDSS). As a conservative C.E.O., pro-life leader and national disability advocate, Weir's entire life has been centered around fighting for people born with pre-existing conditions and giving a voice to the voiceless- all inspired by her best friend of twenty years, Kasey, who has Down syndrome. Sara has always deployed an ""in the trenches"" leadership style by engaging directly with her constituents - meeting with families from the Down syndrome in their local communities, in classrooms, visiting their places of employment and around their kitchen tables.

She built unique coalitions, mobilized new networks of engaged citizens and impacted the lives of countless Americans as she worked to provide public sector solutions to public sector problems. 
Sara led the advocacy effort behind the passage of the landmark, historical Stephen Beck, Jr. Achieving a Better Life Experience (ABLE) Act in 2014- obtaining the support of 85% of the entire US Congress. The ABLE Act establishes tax-free savings accounts for people with disabilities and is hailed as the most significant legislation for the disability community since the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). </p>

			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Who do you look up to? Whose example would you like to follow, and why?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Rep. Dan Crenshaw (R-TX). 
He is in line with my positions on issues, and his style of communication is relatable to the public. He is firm in his beliefs, but truly has a way of helping people see the reasons behind each issue, educating them, not indoctrinating them. It's refreshing to watch a Military approach in Congress, and in my opinion, the Military perspective has been missing and needs to be more prominent.</p>

					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Is there a book, essay, film, or something else you would recommend to someone who wants to understand your political philosophy?</p>

				<p class=""survey-response"">I take pride in the work I do, whether it's helping a buyer find the perfect home, or applying the Federal requirements to the bottle label artwork for the new batch of distilled Vodka. People who know me will tell you that I have the tenacity and attention to detail to not only get the job done, but also execute with accuracy. I am also a strong problem solver and negotiator as both a small business owner and Realtor. These combined skilled have translated well during my 10 years as an advocate for Parents Rights, Veterans Rights, and the rights of Disabled children in my district. These skills also allowed me to assist legal teams in our 3 year fight for our disabled daughter's rights to safety, a case we would not have won without my explicit skill set.

					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What is the first historical event that happened in your lifetime that you remember? How old were you at the time?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I was living in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia with my parents in 1978-1979, as my father was there for business. I remember riding a camel, shopping in souks, and playing with the Arabian children next door to our home. We had a delicious date tree in our front yard, and the electricity would go out almost nightly due to the consistent 120 degree temperature, so we would sleep on the roof. The downstairs bathroom was ridden with cockroaches, the water faucets filled with ants that we would boil and sift out, and I named the lizard on our kitchen window ""Habibi"", meaning ""love"". The only television shows were Gilligan's Island, Fritz the Cat and Betty Boop. There was a local grocer who snuck Christmas lights and a rubber tree plant to us so we could hav a Christmas tree. But the most memorable was the Muslim Mosque with their speaker pointing right outside my 2nd story bedroom window, where I was awakened to the sound of ""Allah Akbar"" over the loud speaker several times each day. One day, we were told to leave Riyadh and flee to London England due to the Iran Hostage Crisis under President Jimmy Carter, and we did. I remember on our first night in the London apartment, I waited in the open window sill for Mary Poppins to visit me, and wound up getting sick. We were there for several months. But once President Ronald Regan was sworn into office, Iran released the Hostages, and we were allowed to return home to America.</p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">What was your very first job? How long did you have it?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I worked at the AMC movie theater in Tucson, AZ. I was 15 years old, and I would ride my bike there. Goonies was the box office hit when I started, so I'm dating myself a bit. I was there for 1 year before being recruited to work at the new Catalina movie theater, a 2 story building that looked like Xanadu. I was there for 3 years, as it was the perfect job for high school and college. I was awarded the employee of the month 9 out of 12 months one year. I loved that job, and I loved that building. Today, it is in ruins, as it is to be torn down for new development.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What happened on your most awkward date?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I'm very inexperienced with dating, really. I was married to my first husband for nearly 20 years. Then, years later with no dates in between, I married my second husband, and we've been married going on 10 years. Clearly, commitment to long term relationships is a non-issue with me.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What is your favorite holiday? Why?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">As a Christian of Episcopal faith, my favorite holidays are Christmas and Easter as they celebrate Christ's birth and ascension. 
As a Tucsonan in Southern Arizona, I always look forward to: Dia De Los Muertos.
This is a festival prayer and remembrance of friends and family members who have died. It has stilt walkers, acrobats, a parade at night lit with fire torches that lead to a giant urn. Participants dressed up in sugar skull face paint and ghostly attire carry photos and details of the loved ones - even pets - they wish to honor, and they take the photos to the urn to burn as way to return the spirits to peace. It's something everyone should experience at least once.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What is your favorite book? Why?</p>

			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">If you could be any fictional character, who would you want to be?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Wonder Woman. I am 6' tall, so when I was a child, I was teased and called an ""Amazon"", which used to bother me. Then Linda Carter's TV show  showing Wonder Woman as a tall, fierce, powerful, strong, beautiful, good, hero... who was also an Amazon, and she has been my favorite DC character, and role model to this day.</p>

				<p class=""survey-response"">It is a Government body made up of elected officials who represent the people. But ""We The People"" has become lost, as the elected officials are no longer made up of every day people from each district. It is made up of professional politicians. ""The People"" want to put the ""We"" back into Congress, starting with me.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Do you believe that it's beneficial for representatives to have previous experience in government or politics?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I must ask ""what experience does an American require other than being a US citizen and being of age""? None. That's not what the founders intended. They wanted real, every day citizens representing other every day citizens. I do believe that there are many truly amazing Congressmen and women currently holding office, as they are true patriots. But I also believe there are many of the wrong groups pushing candidates, and the wrong candidates getting elected, who have the wrong intentions, and the agenda is to change our Nation in ways that are un-American. , and more often times they are the ones with the most ""experience"" in the political arena.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What do you perceive to be the United States’ greatest challenges as a nation over the next decade?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">It comes down to one word -- -- -- RESPECT. 
There is a lack of respect for our President, Administration, Government, Military, Border Patrol Agents, Police, Veterans and those who serve. 
There is a lack of respect for our Rights to Privacy, Civil Liberties, Civil Rights and Freedoms.
There is a lack of respect and simple courtesies between Strangers, Neighbors, Friends and Family.
There is a lack of respect for our Sovereignty as a Nation, Laws, our Constitution, and the Rules that established America today.
This is the time for a new Congress, with new elected perspectives, who are capable of representing our constituents fully, while remaining open to bi-partisan communication and willingness to negotiate for common ground that benefits the many, not the few. 
Now is the time to bridge the gap between ALL PEOPLE in order to create a more peaceful Nation. This is our most important task yet.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">If you are not a current representative, are there certain committees that you would want to be a part of?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Homeland Security, Education </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Do you believe that two years is the right term length for representatives?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">No. In my opinion, it's not long enough, as more than a year of it is spent campaigning for the next election. 4 year terms would be more reasonable.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What are your thoughts on term limits?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">On the surface, the idea of term limits is a strong one, given the potential to forcibly remove the forces of corruption that so many assume dictate the ways of Washington. However, what is more likely to happen is the successful public policies we rely on, would be compromised as a result of our most effective and seasoned lawmakers being forced out of the institution. I believe, as constituents, we should rely on the most effective mechanism available to remove unresponsive, ineffectual members of Congress -- -- -- Elections.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What process do you favor for redistricting?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">The process of common sense. My district, AZ 02, is a poorly drawn... and is a disservice to the public.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">If you are not currently a member of your party’s leadership in the U.S. House of Representatives, would you be interested in joining the leadership? If so, in what role?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">The Freedom Caucus is of great interest to me. I highly respect Rep. Meadows and Rep. Jordan, and value their true representation of the voices of their people, as “the House Freedom Caucus gives a voice to countless Americans who feel that Washington does not represent them. We support open, accountable and limited government, the Constitution and the rule of law, and policies that promote the liberty, safety and prosperity of all Americans.”</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Is there a particular representative, past or present, whom you want to model yourself after?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Dan Crenshaw (R-TX).
He's ticking all the boxes of a truly great leader, consistently showing his integrity and patriotism. I also admire his approach with the American people he addresses through his social media outreach.
He is a man of his word.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Both sitting representatives and candidates for office hear many personal stories from the residents of their district. Is there a story that you’ve heard that you found particularly touching, memorable, or impactful?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">No... and that's the problem. Those running in my state have run for the wrong reasons.</p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">Who are you? Tell us about yourself in 300 words or less.</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Over the course of my life, I've been called many things-ghetto kid, trailer trash, veteran, businessman, husband, father-but I never dreamed I'd be called candidate for U.S. Congress. 

I grew up in Harlem, NY and later, in Oklahoma, where my father was a Drill Sergeant in the US Army. I worked full time delivering pizzas while serving in the Army Reserves to pay for college, and finished in four years. After college, I went on active duty as an officer in the Field Artillery, and also served in South Korea. 

My wife Sheila and I met in high school, and I've been committed to her ever since. We've been married 34 years and have five children, and a Labrador Retriever named Largo. 

For 27 years, I led sales and marketing teams in the healthcare industry with Fortune 100 companies such as Johnson &amp; Johnson, Roche Labs and Medtronic. For the past 15 years, I've worked to transform stagnant or declining business units in the pharmaceutical and medical technology industries by introducing transformative strategies. I now work for a small health-care startup that helps cancer patients tackle their disease.

My faith has guided the important decisions in my life.  I'm not perfect by any means, but my faith has been my ""true north."" It's one of the main reasons I'm so committed to my family. 

My life hasn't always been easy, but it's been a blessing through the good times and the tough times. It has provided me with a foundation of commitment, compassion and courage, as well as the leadership skills I'll take to Congress to put to work for you.</p>

					<li>I know how to create a vision and move people toward a goal that is larger than each individual and that transcends racial, economic and gender differences.</li>

			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What characteristics or principles are most important for an elected official?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">We need true and trusted leaders to take a stand. Elected leaders must operate with the highest ethical standards, and be willing to endure the mud-slinging and persona attacks to fight for what is right.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What qualities do you possess that you believe would make you a successful officeholder?</p>

I have served our country overseas. 
I possess experience in leading teams of people with diverse backgrounds to achieve success.

					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What legacy would you like to leave?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">There are three.
1. Introduce and pass legislation that improves the financial position of Minnesota families.
2. Introduce and pass real and affordable healthcare options for all Americans.
3. Improve Americans' respect for our government (over its current rate of 15%) as an institution that can get things done.   </p>

			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What qualities does the U.S. House of Representatives possess that makes it unique as an institution?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">The U.S. House of Representatives is the branch of the federal government closest to the people. As such, those who serve in it have a unique insight and platform from which they are able to work on the everyday concerns of their constituents. Secondly, in our republican form of government, members of the U.S. House of Representatives are entrusted with the responsibility of using their best judgment to make governing decisions on behalf of the people they serve. This is an incredible honor, but one that requires thoughtful and ethical leadership to be most effective. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Do you believe that it's beneficial for representatives to have previous experience in government or politics?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">No, nor did Thomas Jefferson, who wrote; ""All [reforms] can be... [achieved] peaceably by the people confining their choice of Representatives and Senators to persons attached to republican government and the principles of 1776; not office-hunters, but farmers whose interests are entirely agricultural. Such men are the true representatives of the great American interest and are alone to be relied on for expressing the proper American sentiments."" --Thomas Jefferson to A. Campbell, 1797.

As farming was the chief occupation of his day, Jefferson was clearly expressing the sentiment that everyday Americans, not those with previous experience in government or politics, be the leaders of our nation. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What do you perceive to be the United States’ greatest challenges as a nation over the next decade?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">We are struggling to find a common thread that binds us together as a nation.

We have forgotten or perhaps never learned what makes our country, and us, as Americans, unique. It is important we recapture that understanding or we will continue to fracture as a people. </p>

				</ul>
			</div>
							<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What areas of public policy are you personally passionate about?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Big government is mortgaging our children's futures and a refusal of our current Congress to limit spending will condemn our country to an eventual collapse. I would start with a renewed effort to restore the free market to healthcare.  ObamaCare must be repealed and my opponent refused to vote for a straight repeal. America deserves a Constitutional conservative in the U.S. Senate from West Virginia who isn't afraid to challenge the status quo.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Who do you look up to? Whose example would you like to follow, and why?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I am a devout Christian and there is no higher example than my savior to emulate. That is most important in times of conflict. Politics is about conflict and how the inevitable conflict of ideas can be won, but the victories managed, so that the loser of the policy debate still believes the process was fair and doesn't abandon the process next time for less civilized approaches.</p>

					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What characteristics or principles are most important for an elected official?</p>

			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What qualities do you possess that you believe would make you a successful officeholder?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Like President Lincoln, any public office holder who does not look to a higher authority before he or she makes decisions, lacks the primary quality to lead others. I will do that. 

I order my personal priorities by God, others and then self. My policy approach will be similar. </p>

					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What legacy would you like to leave?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I think that those who seek to leave their legacy through politics has been part of our American dilemma for a few decades now. 

Instead, I plan to be a good neighbor as Robert Frost wrote, and the fences that divide us won't  play such a prominent role in our legacy, instead they will be an opportunity to renew our relationships and minimize our differences.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What is the first historical event that happened in your lifetime that you remember? How old were you at the time?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I was on my way to track practice as a freshman decathlete when we got the news that the space shuttle had exploded. I had friends and relatives who had helped to design and construct our space program and in addition to the loss of the lives of our brave astronauts, I new that tens of thousands of employees' lives at NASA would be forever changed as well. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What was your very first job? How long did you have it?</p>

			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What is something that has been a struggle in your life?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">A common struggle for outspoken conservatives is our attempts to convey to our moderate or liberal opponents, that we too are motivated by love and compassion for our fellow citizens. But our compassion is delivered via logical and strategic policy approaches provided for within the framework of the U. S. Constitution.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What do you perceive to be the United States’ greatest challenges as a nation over the next decade?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">-Our Constitution was designed for a moral people and it shall be wholly insufficient for any other. - The less moral our citizens become, the less likely our Constitutional form of government will remain intact. 

As the resulting policy fissures widen, the national debt, unchecked immigration, violent terroristic attacks, and the loss of selflessness for our fellow citizens will continue to unravel the America that most patriots cherish, </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What qualities does the U.S. Senate possess that makes it unique as an institution?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">The design of the two-representative per state model of the Senate, by the founding fathers, guaranteed that even the small states would have a place at the table of ideas of governing our Congress. West Virginia as a small state certainly benefits from that design. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Do you believe that it’s beneficial for senators to have previous experience in government or politics?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">The complexities of American policy and the potential impact of Senate votes on cultural and international, geopolitical dynamics, are not for the uninitiated. Our system makes it possible for a well-liked figure, perhaps even the child of a former politician,  to be elected to the Senate. But that does not mean that that incumbent is best suited to lead on policy change when the courage to make a countercultural vote is nexessary. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What do you think of the filibuster?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Lawmaking is designed to be a slow process to protect against mob rule. The fewer laws we have the less our freedom infringed upon. If the country is so divided that the filibuster causes fewer laws to be passed then perhaps that os a good thing. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What criteria would you apply when deciding whether to confirm presidential appointees?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Are they Constitutional origionalists?</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Do you believe it’s beneficial to build relationships with other senators?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Politics is a team sport. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">If you are not a current senator, are there certain committees that you would want to be a part of?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Ways and Means

If you make the rules you make the policy. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Is there a particular senator, past or present, whom you want to model yourself after?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Modeling ones self after any Senator who has continued to spend our nation into almost unrecognizable debt is the exact opposite of why I am running for the Senate.</p>

Not only did she have to quit her job, but she also had to spend all of her savings to care for herself and her mother. 

This is a recurring story throughout the district and country.</p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">Who are you? Tell us about yourself in 300 words or less.</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I thought the fight of my life would be over the deserts of Iraq and the mountains of Afghanistan, but it was with my newborn in the Intensive Care Unit at Children's Hospital. Henry is healthy now, but I met so many families who were trying to get the care they needed without going bankrupt. That's why I'm running for Congress. For far too long, Washington politicians have served the special interests instead of our country and the people they represent.  

I'm the daughter of immigrants who worked hard to achieve the American Dream. My dad emigrated from the Philippines as a teenager and worked as an auto mechanic. My mom came to the United States as a young child, started as a secretary, and eventually finished college at the age of 52. 

After September 11th, I signed up for pilot training, where I met my husband, Rob. We deployed together three times, and I deployed twice more. After leaving active duty we settled in Mason, Ohio, where I was accepted into GE Aviation's Junior Officer Leadership Program. I'm ready to continue my service to country as the next Representative of Ohio's First District.</p>

As the mother of a child with a pre-existing cardiac condition and the daughter of a father who went on disability for a back injury, that caused our family to go bankrupt; we must make healthcare more accessible and affordable; lower prescription drug cost through negotiations, and include mental health and addiction treatment services to ensure a holistic approach to care for all Ohioans.</p>

					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Is there a book, essay, film, or something else you would recommend to someone who wants to understand your political philosophy?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Profiles in Courage- John F. Kennedy Jr. - There have been great leaders throughout our country's history who have done the right thing regardless of the consequence to their personal political career. I believe we need leaders of character in elected office to serve to fight for what's right. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What characteristics or principles are most important for an elected official?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Integrity First, Service Before Self, Excellence

These are the US Air Force core values that I have embodied my entire adult life. All constituents deserve a representative with honor &amp; integrity.  It takes real commitment to put service before self, where the needs of the constituents in the district are a priority.  As an Air Force pilot, there are flying standards that you must uphold for yourself and your fellow crew members for the safety of all even in the midst of combat danger. Elected officials should hold that same level of accountability that we are accustomed to in the aviation world and when serving in uniform. 
</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What qualities do you possess that you believe would make you a successful officeholder?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Servant Leadership, it is the true north that guides my military career and community life.  After having served in the U.S. Air Force active duty for 12 years as a pilot with 217 combat missions over Iraq &amp; Afghanistan throughout five deployments, I am accustomed to putting the needs of country first.  As a candidate for Ohio State House in 2018, I ran for office while pregnant with our youngest son, Henry, because the community asked me to challenge an incumbent who did not show up to work.  As a candidate for U.S. Congress in OH-1, I'm running to stand up for families like my own. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What do you believe are the core responsibilities for someone elected to this office?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Being a U.S. House Representative is about serving the constituents of Ohio's First District.  I believe my core responsibility is to listen and serve the needs of the people.  Whether it be writing legislation that will bring jobs and opportunity to the district or partnering with bi-partisan colleagues to deliver for the future of the country, I am excited to further my service to this country in Congress.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What legacy would you like to leave?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I believe from my faith that we are only on this Earth for a small amount of time, and we cannot waste it.  If I listen and pray, I will hear how I am called to serve as a daughter, sister, mother, wife, Air Force officer, pilot, business woman, activist, or candidate; our roles change like the seasons, but I have learned that you must follow your heart and watch for the doors when they open and have the courage to walk through them.  Each role should be for the purpose of serving the greater good. 

The legacy I want to leave as a member of Congress is lifting up hard working families and our planet towards a brighter future by doing the right thing even when it is hard. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What was your very first job? How long did you have it?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I had two jobs during high school - Soccer Referee and Daycare Assistant. Being a Soccer Referee taught me about fair play, following and enforcing the rules. Sometimes that meant having a middle aged adult angry about a call I made. That courage to stand up for what's right regardless of the consequences has continued throughout my entire life. Being a Daycare Assistant taught me at a young age the value of early childhood education. </p>

					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What was the last song that got stuck in your head?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">\""If You're Out There\""-- John Legend - It is a call to action for my generation to step up and get involved with the forming of our nation. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What is something that has been a struggle in your life?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Having spent 12 years active duty in the U.S. Air Force, deploying five times to Iraq and Afghanistan one of my biggest struggles was coming home after being deployed to Afghanistan. I had a young son and husband at home. We were separated for 11 months, and re-integration was a challenge. This challenge is not unique to me and my family. All military families have some struggle getting settled back into \""normal\"" day-to-day life. </p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">Who are you? Tell us about yourself in 300 words or less.</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Like the Vice President, I am a Christian, a conservative and a Republican, in that order, but, in VA8, my first two priorities have me running as an Independent.</p>
			</div>
						    <div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Please list below 3 key messages of your campaign. What are the main points you want voters to remember about your goals for your time in office?</p>
				<ul class=""key-messages"">
					<li>VA8 is the kingmaker district that has decided the outcome of statewide races for the past two decades, and POTUS need only pick up eight points.</li>
					<li>Since 2018, POTUS has enjoyed an approval rating amongst African Americans over 30%, and is performing well with Latinos.</li>
					<li>65% of Americans support some restrictions on abortion, and a single issue pro life voter (45%) is more likely to vote than a pro choice voter (35%). </li>
				</ul>
			</div>
							<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What areas of public policy are you personally passionate about?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">As a constitutional conservative, I favor smaller government, lower taxes, and personal liberty, including the sanctity of life and the unabridged right to bear arms.

As the son and grandson of fundamentalist Baptist pastors, with two family churches on the National Historic Registry, and as a member of a Southern Baptist Church, I am in line with the Founders who made Freedom of Religion the first liberty in the Bill of Rights.

As a retired field grade officer with assignments in special operations and strategic counterintelligence, I support a strong deterrent to aggression and the ability to defend our borders and our strategic interests around the world, but reject the notion that our military power should be used as world police.

My military experience informs my heritage as the great grandson of a Jewish immigrant who fled Germany before the Holocaust, and I recognize the strategic value of Israel, our best friend and ally in the contentious Middle East.

Raised in a family tradition of education, and blessed with the finest education in elite schools, I promote options for School Choice and reforms in public education to ensure proficiency of all students and eliminate the persistent achievement gap that adversely affects children of color.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What characteristics or principles are most important for an elected official?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Even the deist Thomas Jefferson, who tore all references to miracles from his Bible, wrote in an oft misapplied and misunderstood letter that he yet believed that Christianity might one day be the salvation for all mankind, if, in the words of Alexis de Tocqueville, \""rightly understood.\"" And, notwithstanding a doctrine of separation, and constitutional proscriptions against an established church, the men who operate in elected offices must, nonetheless be the best examples of integrity, honor, principle and discipline.  The whole is equal, and not greater than the sum of its parts. Theodore White publicly acknowledged back in 1968 that the popular vote is far too susceptible to the stage illusions created by marketers on Park Avenue, but military officers, faced with similar operating environments, yet, by statistics, representing that demographic in which religious faith finds its highest incidence, are instructed to accept the leadership obligation to be those necessary eyes to ensure safety.  On a live fire range, anyone can and should be a safety officer, but, in the final analysis, the ultimate responsibility is vested in those who assume the mantle of leadership, a responsibility to be held accountable far too often abdicated unashamedly by elected and appointed officials today.  

Machiavelli even warned his prince that, even if it was not necessary that he possess all of those qualities, it  was nonetheless of greatest necessity to maintain legitimacy in power to appear to have those good qualities.  Yet mass demonstrations of \""proud to be nasty women,\"" elected members of Congress publishing press releases to promote their intent to boycott a ceremony that has marked the peaceful transition of power, and a childhood fascination with the adornments of rebellion, provide validated intelligence that progressives have even forgotten the warning of John Kennedy, that those who foolishly ride the back of the tiger, far to often wake up surprised inside.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What qualities do you possess that you believe would make you a successful officeholder?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Despite many glowing officer evaluation reports, as a graduate of Washington &amp; Lee University, where I had attended expressly for its student administered, single sanction honor system, and had the privilege to be elected to serve on the student government body vested with the responsibility to maintain it, I am most proud that over a decade after graduation, my rating officer wrote that I would tell him the truth, even if he did not want to hear it.  Anyone who has served in an organization or who is familiar with peer pressure is well aware that that red badge of courage is a double-edged sword, both blessing and curse.  But I want that to be my enduring legacy, that, at the end of life's journey, it can be said that I fought the good fight, ran the good race, and kept the faith.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What was your very first job? How long did you have it?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">As a preacher's kid, you are born working, printing and folding bulletins and the variety of other assignments that develop around the church, but my first real job was as a first line manager in the fast track Management Intern Program for Bankers Trust New York, one of the major New York City money center commercial banks.  I was assigned to the Delaware subsidiary, and, on the first day, I was summoned to the CEO's office on Park Avenue and given the option to quit because three levels of senior management above me had been asked to resign after it was discovered that they had lost track of a half billion dollars.  The difficulty arose after all banks were required to expedite check processing in the aftermath of the enactment of the Expedited Funds Availability Act of 1988. BTNY decided to open a subsidiary in Delaware to take advantage of the benefits of incorpoation in that state, but also to utilize the Federal Reserve Bank in Philadelphia in processing its official checks because that Federal Reserve Bank had a smaller volume than New York, which had facilities in Manhattan, Jericho, Long Island, and Cranford, New Jersey.  Unfortunately, rather than relocate personnel who had been performing the job for years, the Bank simply asked for volunteers to relocate to Delaware with the incentive of a New York salary.  With nothing to lose, and always up fo an adventure,  I took command of the ground zero operation, and within one year reduced the risk to the bank to a one hundred thousand dollar writeoff.  But, after you have an adrenaline rush experience like that, even the lure of fast track management pales in comparison; so, I headed down to Washington to get a start in politics as a Hill Staffer, but, long story short, Senator McCain straightened me out and told me to just go back home and run for office, because nobody wanted another congressman working in their office.</p>

					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What was the last song that got stuck in your head?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">The final verse of the National Anthem:  O thus be it ever when freed men shall stand between their loved homes and the war's desolation. Blest with victory and peace may the Heaven rescued land praise the Power that hath preserved us one nation.  And conquer we must, for our cause it is just, and this be our motto: in God is our trust.  And the star spangled banner forever shall wave, o'er the land of the free and the homes of the brave.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What do you perceive to be the United States’ greatest challenges as a nation over the next decade?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Every great nation in history that has gone into decline and fallen has crumbled from the inside first, and not by invasion nor necessarily ethnic or religious division.  James Madison specifically stated in Federalist 51, where we find the language about not all men being angels, that the competing religious sects would shape our national conscience, and these were men who could not contemplate the erosion of the basic unit of traditional families.  While, according to the Pew Research Center, over 75% of Americans identify as Christians, in all faiths, the level of devotion to that faith is around half of that. And Pew Research Center credits devotion, or commitment to practices and attendance are the glue that keeps one in the fold.  And, filling the void that must be filled, big government and schools have, against the Constitution, displaced the roles of families and churches.  And the evidence of the effects of the decline in this moral infrastructure, or to use the Strom Thurmond phrase, \""the faith we have not kept,\"" is sounding alarms that are being ignored, in an increasingly emotional and partisan population, where issues and policies, and, as we saw in the impeachment process, even laws, have become irrelevant.  If we do not address this clear and present danger, that government, of the people, by the people and for the people will perish from the earth. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What are your thoughts on term limits?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Discussing term limits provides an opportunity to touch on some other questions regarding length of term and prior political experience.  The Constitution, forged by men with recent experience in tyranny, established a government of limited government, and, as John Adams noted, in his address to the Massachusetts Militia, it was made for a moral and religious people, unsuitable for any other, placing great faith that a \""We, the People,\"" would serve as the ultimate check and balance on a government of separated powers, despite recognition that history had taught that men were accustomed to suffer up to a \""long chain of abuses and discretions,' before seizing their right and duty to alter or abolish a government that had abused its power, and establish new forms of government to ensure their happiness and security.  

Yet, in a growing humanist secularism, the popular vote in 2016, as well as the naïve infatuation, amongst a miseducated plebiscite that has embraced the proletarian hopes for some utopian ideal that has never been great, validate the skepticism expressed by Benjamin Franklin that a popularly elected government might be able to keep a democratic republic.  The huddled masses today no longer \""yearn to breathe free\"" as a priority, are unaware of Lord Acton's warning that all \""power tends to corrupt, absolute power absolutely,\"" and are doomed to repeat a forgotten history.

Accordingly, beyond the expressed qualifications in the Constitution, it should be self-evident that representatives elected to operate the legislative power require at a minimum an understanding of jurisprudence and the operation of laws, about which the doctrine of deference, compels our courts to rely on their deliberations and wisdom. And any candidate quickly recognizes the necessity of understanding the operation of politics. Limiting access to corrupting power, as done for the executive, is the best and only way to curb that appetite, oft expressed to reject limits on terms.</p>

					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Both sitting representatives and candidates for office hear many personal stories from the residents of their district. Is there a story that you’ve heard that you found particularly touching, memorable, or impactful?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Particularly as a challenger candidate, you should have an incentive to break outside your routine and meet new people and expose yourself to new ideas, and, in my first run for Congress in 2016, I had the opportunity to attend the convention for the Federation of the Blind.  There I met an incredible young lady who had planned after high school to enlist in the Marine Corp, continuing a military tradition in her family, like a far too small number of Americans who give military service a thought.  But, at the Miltary Entrance Processing Center, she learned that she would be totally blind before she graduated from high school, ending abruptly the promise of her career goals.  And, it was at this point in her story where I was truly taken by surprise.  She said very matter of factly that when she learned that she would be blind, she decided that she would just have to use Plan B, a phrase that resonated with me, especially considering the high rates of suicide today, especially amongst military veterans.  Plan Be.  Of course.

This young lady did not do what probably most of us would do when hit by devastating news.  She did what we teach Rangers: improvise and overcome.  Perhaps that was because her daddy was a Ranger and raised his children with those same values.  And, by the time I met her, she had graduated from college, and had already received her masters degree, and was working with the Department of Veterans Affairs.  Plan Be.  Put that out in formation, as we say in the Army.</p>

I am running for Congress in the district I'm born and raised in. I am the father of two amazing little boys, husband to superwoman, the son of two retired Arizona public school teachers, brother to a US Army Captain, and Uncle to the sweetest little girl. I was drafted by the New York Yankees and played a few seasons of professional baseball. I then began a career as a video engineer and director for major music artists on their world concert tours. Traveling the world many times over gave me an interesting perspective on life, morality, and humanity. I came home after years of traveling and have owned my own small business for more than 6 years while maintaining my professional career in the entertainment industry. I am a doer not a complainer. My platform is based on representing the people of CD8 and solving the problems all of us as American's need solutions to. I believe in an efficient and effective government. I believe our values, our hometown, and our country are always worth fighting for.</p>

					<li>Healthcare is a basic human right. It should be made more affordable, provide 100% coverage, and protect those with pre-exisiting conditions</li>
					<li>Immigration reform requires leaders who want to fix it rather than use it as an issue for political gain. We can start by revising our visa system, upgrading our ports of entry and adequately funding our border patrol, case officers, judges, and healthcare officials to prevent human/drug trafficking and create fair labor practices. </li>

							<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What areas of public policy are you personally passionate about?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Owning a gun is not exclusive to a political party. As a gun owner I am passionate about protecting our 2nd amendment rights. As a father and responsible gun owner I realize that today's society calls for common sense safety reforms which proactively prevent threats without infringing upon the 2A. Our lives and that of our children are worth it.

As a business owner, husband, father, friend and world traveler to a variety of cultures and regions of the world, I am passionate about equal rights, be them having to do with equal pay, voting, gender, sexual orientation, religion, or healthcare. Equality means equality. 

I'm also passionate about protecting our privacy as citizens, our healthcare, immigration, climate/environment, our economy, tax policy, supreme court and judicial system in general, drug and mental health issues, secondary education and student loans, pensions and retirement protections, election security, campaign finance transparency, private prison industry, our military and wars overseas, and our transportation/infrastructure. </p>

					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Who do you look up to? Whose example would you like to follow, and why?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I look up to my parents, both now retired Arizona public school teachers. My entire life they worked multiple jobs to support my brother and I. They did it so we could have a better life and more opportunity than they had. It's a work ethic I've carried over into my own life and approach as a husband and father.

I also look up to my little brother. He continues to serve our country as a member of the US Army. Many of the proudest moments of my life have come from the joy of his successes following his dreams and achieving his goals. 

I look up to my wife. In my family our women stand right beside us. Her strength, her compassion, her ability to handle me and our two boys...is nothing shy of inspiring.</p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">What qualities does the U.S. House of Representatives possess that makes it unique as an institution?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">The U.S House of Representatives possesses the ability to provide a guardian like oversight over their constituents, the co-equal branches of government as a check and balance, and has the ability to make our lives better across the country through well thought out policy and legislation. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Do you believe that it's beneficial for representatives to have previous experience in government or politics?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I believe that experience in government and politics has proven for those who have been in office now for years to be part of the problem rather than the solution. Life experience is unique to each individual. My experience as a world traveler, a business owner, a professional athlete, and in the highly competitive and demanding entertainment industry provides me with a very unique ability to work together with people of all walks of life. As a father and small business owner the decisions I make directly effect my life, my business, and my children's futures. We need more elected officials with skin in the game, the ability to think for themselves rather than act as talking heads for political parties or special interests, and people who have a vision for the future and a plan to get us there.</p>

			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Do you believe that two years is the right term length for representatives?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I believe that a representatives job is to represent all of their constituents best interests. Whatever their term is they should serve those interests at all times. Should they fail to do so, they should be removed. I also believe representatives should be required to hold public appearances for their constituents via open to the public, free, and unscreened question town halls. Failure to engage with constituents and/or only meeting with political party affiliated clubs and voters allows for continued division and lack of transparency and accountability.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What are your thoughts on term limits?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">We have term limits. They are called elections. If representatives fail to do their jobs, they should be voted out. I also believe that elected officials who shut down the government should not be eligible for re-election nor receive pay during the shut down.</p>

					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Both sitting representatives and candidates for office hear many personal stories from the residents of their district. Is there a story that you’ve heard that you found particularly touching, memorable, or impactful?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Each event I attend I come across people telling me their stories about their healthcare bills and prescription costs. Whether it's people telling me they would be dead without pre-existing condition protections, parents of children who were born with conditions dependent on expensive treatments, the business owner trying to hire good employees but cant afford benefits to retain them, or the average family struggling to simply cover the cost to insure themselves and their children. Each and every story is humbling, inspiring, personal, and makes me even more determined to see this mission through. </p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">What would be your top three priorities, if elected?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">My main priorities for my first term in office will include moving towards universal healthcare, fixing our broken education system, and reducing the negative effects of climate change.  Fulfilling these priorities will be no easy task, but I have always been one to step up when there's a need for leadership. After serving six years in the Navy and running my own small business I know what it takes to get the job done.
Too many of us don't have insurance or simply cannot afford it. The costs of prescription medication, basic tests and visiting a doctor are simply too high for way too many American families. Meanwhile, our healthcare system is one of the most expensive in the world. Since we spend so much on healthcare, shouldn't we be the healthiest country in the world with the best patient outcomes? Unfortunately, this is not the case. In my view, access to affordable, quality healthcare is a fundamental human right, not a privilege. We should work towards universal coverage for all Americans.

Our nation is facing an educational crisis. States continue to cut real funding for both K-12 schools and public universities and technical colleges. The Trump administration is waging an all-out war on our schools, threatening our future with policies that seek to undermine our entire public education system. Wisconsin's ranking for investment in education is sinking. We have to reverse this trend. Our public education system needs to be strengthened and protected. This means that we have to adequately fund our K-12 education system and work to solve the student debt loan crisis.
Climate change is the greatest challenge of our time. But, as I've always said, the world's greatest challenges create the world's greatest opportunities. We owe it to our children to fix our mistakes and leave our beautiful planet in better shape than we found it. We can do this by first recommitting to the Paris Climate Agreement because America should be a leader in solving the issue of climate change. Then we ought to shift our focus to research in to renewable energy and working towards achieving 100% renewable energy by 2050.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What areas of public policy are you personally passionate about?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I'm running for Congress because we need to create an economy that doesn't just work for a few Americans but instead gives everyone a chance at achieving the American dream. First and foremost, we need a Medicare for All system for healthcare that ensures every American can be healthy and live to their fullest potential. Healthcare should be a right for everyone in this country, to ensure that every member of our society is able to achieve their own American dream without fear of bankruptcy or death.
I also believe we need to ensure all of us can earn a liveable wage, because too many Americans are still working two or three jobs in order to support their families. We also must fix our broken education system to ensure that future generations of Americans are able to get good-paying jobs. This means we must lower debt for college graduates and fully fund our public school systems. This country is built on the idea that every single one of us is entitled to Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. Our country is going down a dark path and we have to decide who we are as Americans. Are we the country of opportunity, equality, and democracy, or are we a society that works only for the richest amongst us to everyone else's detriment.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Who do you look up to? Whose example would you like to follow, and why?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Theodore Roosevelt is someone I greatly admire. His dedication to reforming civil service ensured that public servants were chosen for their merits and helped insulate civil service and many federal programs from political whims. As someone who enjoys the outdoors and is dedicated to protecting our environment, his work in conservation and jumpstarting our National Parks System is inspiring. Roosevelt was someone with deep progressive beliefs who put his leadership skills to work for the betterment of all Americans, and his actions have shaped this country for the better.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What qualities do you possess that you believe would make you a successful officeholder?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I'm a small business owner and Navy veteran challenging a 40-year incumbent to bring responsible leadership back to Wisconsin's 5th congressional district. After serving on a nuclear submarine in the Navy, I spent 15 years in risk management for banks, and as Treasurer of the mortgage division at a major bank, my foresight helped that Institution avoid participating in the risky lending that led to the 2008 crash. I then started my own small business helping other local small businesses create good-paying jobs, including more than 1,000 in the last two years. I believes in servant leadership, and I believes in Wisconsin.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What do you believe are the core responsibilities for someone elected to this office?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">The most important responsibility for a member of the House of Representatives is to not only listen to their constituents, but to work for them as well. This means that representatives must be willing to work across the aisle and be willing to cross party votes in order to get things done for the people of their district. This is something that has been completely absent from the Wisconsin's fifth Congressional district. Representative Jim Sensenbrenner has lost touch with his constituents and no longer represents their best interests. I'm running to change that.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What do you perceive to be the United States’ greatest challenges as a nation over the next decade?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Partisan gridlock is not only the greatest challenges of our lifetime, but it is one of the biggest threats to our republic as a whole. Politicians are more concerned about aligning party and special interests rather than voting for what they think is right. We have to elect leaders that are more concerned with passing legislation that helps their constituents. When elected, I will be determined to work across the aisle with my fellow legislators and pass meaningful legislation that helps the people of WIsconsin's fifth Congressional district.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What process do you favor for redistricting?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Being from Wisconsin, I know the negative implications that gerrymandering can have on a thriving democracy. My opponent has been in office for 40 years mostly because Wisconsin's 5th Congressional District has been drawn in a way that makes it one of the most republican districts in the country. I don't believe that those elected to public office should be able to draw their own district lines. People should be elected on ideas, and re-elected on results. In too many parts of our country, that's not the case. I favor a redistricting process similar to the one used in Iowa. The state of Iowa created a nonpartisan board to work on legislative districts give the people of Iowa fair and competitive maps. It's been working pretty well in Iowa and I think it's a similar model that could work for the rest of the country.</p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">Who are you? Tell us about yourself in 300 words or less.</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I am Alexis Johnson, born and raised in New Mexico, I graduated from New Mexico Tech with an Engineering Degree. After graduation, I worked in the oil fields of the Permean Basin protecting the environment. I moved back to New Mexico to grow my family. I live in Santa Fe, New Mexico and I am proud to be a New Mexican. I believe in Traditional Family values. I believe in the U.S. Constitution and I am a strong advocate of the freedoms and rights protected by the first and second amendments to the U.S. Constitution.</p>
			</div>
						    <div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Please list below 3 key messages of your campaign. What are the main points you want voters to remember about your goals for your time in office?</p>
				<ul class=""key-messages"">
					<li>I believe in a government For the People and By the People. I am a Native New Mexican who comes from humble beginnings, and I will stand up for the average New Mexican.</li>
					<li>I believe that the United States and New Mexican Government has strayed from the principles and values that made us great. I am a fiscal conservative, god-fearing mother and wife. </li>
					<li>I worked for years in the Oil Fields of the Permean Basin, one of America's (and New Mexico's) most valuable Natural Resources. I will work every day to pass and enact legislation at the federal level to ensure Oil and Gas resources in New Mexico are responsibly extracted and maintained for future Generations. </li>
				</ul>
			</div>
							<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What areas of public policy are you personally passionate about?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I am a strong proponent of personal freedom, religious freedom, and economic freedom. I come from humble beginnings, but through hard work I have succeeded, and I want to be the example to all New Mexicans that hard work pays off. For far too long, New Mexicans have been victimized and robbed of their dignity and natural resources. I will continue to promote the benefits of Oil, Gas, Mining and Ranching/Farming industries to New Mexico Families and Economy.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Is there a book, essay, film, or something else you would recommend to someone who wants to understand your political philosophy?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">My favorite film is ""Forrest Gump"" because it is a fictionalized version of American history and the movie follows Forrest Gump from a young age, growing up in ""Greensboro, Alabama"" and follows his life as he plays pivotal roles in many of America's greatest moments in history, for example, Watergate, Vietnam, etc. 

I love the format of the film because we see Forrest at different ages in his life which allows him to understand him fully as a person. I believe Forrest Gump would be considered a fiscal conservative, like many in his generation of that time period, as he fought in Vietnam, then becomes a very successful business owner through starting ""Bubba Gump Fishing Company"" and then investing in 'Apple' early. 

Also growing up in post World War II Southern United States, whose family lived on (what seems to be) a former plantation. 

Forrest Gump is my favorite movie and will help you to understand my political philosophy because, Forrest Gump is just one person in time, without any extraordinary luck or skill, and who was privileged to live in the United States, was able to achieve so much in his life time. Even though it's a fictionalized film, it shows an amazing time in American history, which has laid the foundation for the society we all currently live in the real United States.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What characteristics or principles are most important for an elected official?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Diligence - Working every day on productive activities: passing legislation, calling constituents, building coalitions with other political figures

Honesty - Faithfully performing the duties and responsibilities of my office. Upholding my sworn oath.

Integrity - Communicating effectively and honestly with constituents.

Republicanism and Fiscal Conservativism - My first job is as a representative of my constituents in Washington: to vote for their interests and ensuring responsibility in government so that resources are used for the benefit of the public.

Rule of Law / Due Process - I believe in the U.S. Constitution, separation of powers, and the process of U.S. Government as a great experiment

					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What qualities do you possess that you believe would make you a successful officeholder?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I consider myself a professional in all of my endeavors and I have been successful as an Engineer, Rancher, Mother and I will work every day to be successful as a politician as the Voice of New Mexico.

			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What legacy would you like to leave?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">In general, I hope to leave a legacy of fiscal responsibility, and return the government, power and money to the people of Northern New Mexico. I want to return a sense of pride to Northern New Mexico that I believe is missing due to the lies of victimhood that has been sold to us throughout history for a certain segment of society's benefit. Return government to serving the people and Traditional New Mexican Family Values. 

Specifically, I would like to focus on legislation that will maximize the economic benefits of the incredible Natural Resource of a portion of the Permean Basin in Southeastern New Mexico.To ensure that one of our most valuable resources is responsibly extracted, protected and maintained for generations. Ensure that Government works to reduce 'red tape' and bureaucracy standing in the way of new improvements and innovation, while maintaining a high level of environmental responsibility and protection. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What is your favorite book? Why?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">My favorite book is ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" because we are able to see Atticus, Finch's Father and his legal and social struggles through the innocent eyes of a child and the black-and-white right-and-wrong understanding of the world as seen by a 5 year old. </p>

				<p class=""survey-response"">I previously mentioned Forrest Gump in this survey, but I believe Forrest Gump would be fantastic life to live because of everything he was able to see and experience, including meeting multiple U.S. Presidents. 

Other than Forrest Gump, I would want to be Frodo in the Lord of the Rings trilogy because, although he is a hobbit (small stature), he ventures on an incredible journey and ultimately succeeds in his mission.</p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">What was the last song that got stuck in your head?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Fleetwood Mac ""Dreams"". I am a huge Stevie Nicks fan! Such a beautiful voice and lyrics. Also I love ""Rhiannon"". </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What is something that has been a struggle in your life?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Democrats constantly telling me that I'm a victim. Life is full of adversity for everyone, you've got to keep moving forward! Overcome adversity! I learned to have an innate belief in myself and my abilities.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What qualities does the U.S. House of Representatives possess that makes it unique as an institution?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">The bi-cameral form of government (U.S. House and U.S. Senate) instituted in the Legislative Branch of the U.S. Government, known as the 'great compromise', has created a separation of power (among branches of government) while providing adequate representation to local populace to chose their own representation in washington, providing a meritocracy where new ideas and methods can thrive and old, inefficient ideas will fall by the wayside. The 'Republic', where voters democratically elect a representative and send that person to Washington, D. C. is the absolutely most effective way to ensure that ""The People's"" voice is heard, while also allowing small minority groups to also have their issues resolved in a fair and efficient process. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Do you believe that it's beneficial for representatives to have previous experience in government or politics?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">My previous experience was as an engineer, working in the oil fields to solve America's most pressing challenge: meeting our daily energy needs which allow the quality of life that we all enjoy. I believe that I bring a fresh perspective to government, and experience from the private sector, with a very high standard of duty to meet every day. On the other hand, a career politician will not have the direct experience with the technical challenges I faced as an engineer. Therefore, I believe that when the time comes to institute new laws and regulation, as is the responsibility of Representatives and the Legislative Branch, I will be able to speak from direct, on the ground experience, which will yield a better solution in the regulation for oil &amp; gas companies, the environment, and the communities we all serve.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What do you perceive to be the United States’ greatest challenges as a nation over the next decade?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">An increased population and standard of living can only be maintained through reliable, low cost energy in high quantities, which can only be achieved with increased production of raw materials from Oil, Gas &amp; Mining industries. We will have significant technical and social challenges to meet these demands.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">If you are not a current representative, are there certain committees that you would want to be a part of?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I will seek to join the committees relating to Energy, Natural Resources, and Oil and Gas due to my knowledge, experience, and connections as an engineer working in this industry.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">If you are a current representative, why did you join your current committees?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">N/A</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Do you believe that two years is the right term length for representatives?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I believe two years is the best term length for Representatives, because the House of Representatives was intended, by the founding fathers, to be 'closer to the people', and more easily elected and replaced which can provide temporary power to a special interest group at the right time in history. Also, the House of Representatives is based upon the population, each with equal weight, and therefore the House of Representatives can better reflect the exact politics of ""The People"" more rapidly than the U.S. Senate. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What are your thoughts on term limits?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I believe that Term Limits have their place in certain offices, such as the U.S. Presidency, however, history has shown the power of long serving Representatives and Senators and their ability to achieve dramatic results, so I personally do not believe there should be term limits on U.S. Representatives or Senators due to their large number, whereas, to have a president for more than two terms could be a significant problem. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">If you are not currently a member of your party’s leadership in the U.S. House of Representatives, would you be interested in joining the leadership? If so, in what role?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I am not interested in pursuing leadership until I gain experience as a Representative. Also I am more interested in advancing legislation regarding Oil &amp; Gas than primarily focusing on Politics. </p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">Who are you? Tell us about yourself in 300 words or less.</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I am an Air Force Veteran, I have been an aircraft mechanic, a systems engineer and I was a single working mom. While working full time, I went to college and earned my bachelor's degree in Professional Aeronautics.

I am running for Congress because we need a Representative cares and will fight for the people.

As an active duty member of USAF, now a veteran and the daughter of a veteran I have experienced the challenges and hardships of being an active duty military member and a family member of one. 

As a Lead Systems Engineer I lead diverse teams of people in states across the nation to get things done.  
My experience as a systems engineer means I know how to accurately identify problems, find solutions to them, and how to get those solutions put in place. 

From being a mechanic I know what it is like to have busted knuckles from working hard all day, I know and value that this country was built by the members of the working class.

I was a single working mom which means I really get the challenges of balancing home, work and finding good childcare.

				<p class=""survey-response"">I am a 24 year US Army Veteran, Green Beret, father, grandfather, and Duke University MBA program graduate. 

Public service is more than just something we aspire to; it is a responsibility and a calling. We must act on it and serve our neighbors. 

I push to confront our nation's problems with determination and resourcefulness, fueled by the founding principles of individual liberty, limited government, and economic empowerment. It is the people's county and the American citizens are the sovereigns of this great nation. 

For me, people are the core of every aspect in life. Whether it is business or military operations, jobs and the economy, or law making and speaking, everything is founded, run by, and impacts people. God's most precious creation is at the pinnacle of value in the world and communities in which we live. 

My thoughts and considerations always focus on the  individual people involved and how my decisions and actions will impact their lives.</p>

America is now the world's leader in energy production and Pennsylvania is the second largest producer of natural gas and third largest producer of coal in the nation.

Healthcare
We must reduce the enormous cost burden and start putting free market principles in place, removing restrictive regulations, and repealing the Affordable Care Act \""Obamacare\"".

Jobs &amp; the Economy
Our economy is booming, we must continue to promote new job creation by cutting regulations and bureaucratic red tape, permanently lowering taxes, and demanding free and fair trade.

LEO's &amp; 1st Responders
Our LEO's and 1st responders are out there every day. They deserve all the funding and support required to keep the peace and respond to emergencies as the happen.

Military &amp; Veterans
America has the greatest military in the world because of its men and women in uniform. We must honor our nation's commitment to those who have served and to their families.

National Security
The federal government's primary constitutional responsibility is to provide national security; through strong trade agreements, economic leadership, military might, and border control.

Rights &amp; Freedoms
The Constitution defines the rights of American citizens. We must be extremely vigilant in defending against those who'd take our God given rights &amp; freedoms and/or erode our civil liberties.

				<p class=""survey-question"">Who are you? Tell us about yourself in 300 words or less.</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">      I was born in Dayton, Ohio in 1966 to Wayne and Wilma Musselwhite. We gradually moved south throughout the years from Ohio, Kentucky, Tennessee, Alabama and finally to Florida. I graduated from Mobile County High School in Alabama, Class of 1984.
    After years as a pipefitter and welder I became an American Welding Society (AWS) Certified Welding Inspector (CWI). Welding Codes and specifications are in place to ensure the safety of those at the facilities as well as the surrounding communities.  These jobs have been located all over the US, from Florida to Washington St. and from Texas to Minnesota.  Currently I am working to build the first nuclear power plant in the US since River Bend Plant which went online in 1986.   Providing quality oversight is an enormous responsibility, and I am grateful they thought I had the integrity, as well as the intelligence to fulfill their commitment to quality. 
   Traveling across this great country has given me a unique perspective and allowed me to meet a lot of people from various backgrounds and cultures.  Each place has its own way of solving problems.  We can learn much from other's successes as well as their failures.
   After years of travel working as a welder and currently as an inspector, my children are now adults with families of their own. I look forward to the next chapter in our lives, and taking an even greater responsibility, meeting the challenges of representing Florida District 20.

				<p class=""survey-question"">Please list below 3 key messages of your campaign. What are the main points you want voters to remember about your goals for your time in office?</p>
				<ul class=""key-messages"">
					<li>We must Build the Wall and secure the border for the security of our nation. Immigration reform is essential, we need immigrants to grow our nation but there are laws that govern this process.</li>
					<li>Our next looming crisis is the national debt. We as a Nation cannot continue to put the burden on our children, a ballanced budget is necessary. </li>
					<li>The current state of our government is a testimony for the need for term limits for Congress. Being in a job too long leads to complacency at best and corruption at worst.</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
							<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What areas of public policy are you personally passionate about?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Indisputably, immigration is one of the biggest debates of this century.  It is a complicated problem compounded by a Congress who has refused to solve our broken immigration policy for years.  Now, it is a crisis.
Mass numbers of people are gaining entry without:
1.	 Proper documentation, which bypasses screening process (cuts line for legal immigrants)
2.	 Health records / immunizations, brings an alarming increase in once eradicated diseases, like measles
3.	Criminal background checks, this allows human traffickers to exploit women and children as well as allow Drug cartels to increase the flow of illegal drugs
The desire of a better life in America is understandable (especially at taxpayer's expense), and many risk the journey to escape bad situations in their home country.  The first step in solving any problem is to gain control of the situation.  To fix the immigration problem, we must secure the border now.  Then we can develop a plan to help not only the ones already here, but the ones who still want to come, true immigration reform.
Illegal immigration affects every facet of our lives, from impacts to health care to jobs.  America needs immigrants to help grow our economy by bringing in people that will contribute to our labor force.  New people bring fresh ideas, diversity and a different perspective, allowing the U.S. to continue to be the best we can be.

				<p class=""survey-question"">What characteristics or principles are most important for an elected official?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Statesmanship has been sorely lacking in our politicians as of late.  There used to be a certain dignity of office that people respected, even if the representative was from an opposing party.  It is an old joke about politicians lying whenever they speak, but I believe Honesty and Integrity should be high on your list for a politician. 

In todays world there is a camera in your face almost every waking moment, so it is very easy to be caught out in a lie.  It is best to always ""say what you mean, mean what you say.""  Don't try to be cute and twist words or put a spin on things.  I respect the individual who speaks their mind and is straight with me, tell me the truth.   </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What qualities do you possess that you believe would make you a successful officeholder?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Honesty, Integrity, and a strong work ethic.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What legacy would you like to leave?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">That I served my country, and did my best to represent the citizens of my district.  I am not looking to be famous, just leave a better place for the children and grandchildren of this nation.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What is the first historical event that happened in your lifetime that you remember? How old were you at the time?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">August 16th 1977 we lived in Coalfield TN and I was 11 years old.  My aunt was a big music fan and I can remember her playing records of Loretta Lynn, Dolly Parton and of course Elvis.  The TV networks had just broadcast the news of Presley's death and she was crying.  At this time of my life it was a shock to hear of the death of someone so young and vibrant.  It was my first exposure to the dangers of drug use.  This was a profoundly shocking moment for me and I have never felt the need to experiment with drug use.  I don't know if it was the loss of the entertainer or the sound of my aunt's grief that affected me more. Drugs have robbed so many of us of loved ones, and deigned the world of so much that was beautiful. 

</p>

					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What was the last song that got stuck in your head?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Baby Shark.... tell me it isn't stuck in yours now... I still love the grandbabies though.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What is something that has been a struggle in your life?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I would have to say the most common thing people struggle with, losing weight... I really love my wife's cooking.  As I have aged it gets harder and with the onset of type 2 diabetes it is much harder. But with a loving family I have made strides and am continuing to get my weight down to a more managable and healthy range.  I still have a weakness for pumpkin pie....</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Do you believe that it's beneficial for representatives to have previous experience in government or politics?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Experience in government can be beneficial, but not necessary.  Government has become a business unto itself and has been run inefficiently, not utilizing tax dollars to their fullest. It is always good to pool people with differing backgrounds and experiences to get new ideas.  How can a government represent people if all of the officials are of a particular background?  Politicians have to have real world experiences outside of government to know how policies affect people.  A government for the people by the people...

For instance, how could one have meaningful input to a committee like ""Armed Services"", without ever serving in the military?  I believe it is important for a representative to bring ""subject matter expertise"" to be able to fashion legislation that will not have unintended consequences, and actually help our citizens. 

Being in power too long is not good, term limits are needed.  Being in any job for too long leads to complacency and sometimes corruption.  The founding fathers intended for a representative to serve for a time and return to private life.  </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What do you perceive to be the United States’ greatest challenges as a nation over the next decade?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">The greatest challenge facing our nation will be uniting as a country. The division runs deep along political lines and as each party tries to dominate the news cycle for attention, it is with identity politics. We are divided by age; sex; race; culture and every other conceivable statistical category.  WE ARE AMERICANS! This is the greatest nation on Earth because of our diversity, and our ability to innovate. 

 Civility and respect for other people's opinion used to be the norm, now with social media leading the way each side ""vilifies"" the other. The First amendment entitles you to speak your mind, but does not give you the right to harass people in public because you don't agree with their point of view.  If we all treated others how we would like to be treated, it would be a step toward healing the divide in our nation.

</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">If you are not a current representative, are there certain committees that you would want to be a part of?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I would be happy to serve on any committee where my background and experiences would contribute meaningful input into their deliberations.

With a background as a welder and inspector working on petrochemical and energy production, Energy and or Labor would seem a natural fit.  A passion for fishing and the great outdoors would lead me to environmental concerns and the Natural Resources committee. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Do you believe that two years is the right term length for representatives?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">A two year individual term is sufficient, giving time to propose legislation and see it to fruition.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What are your thoughts on term limits?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">The 22nd amendment limits the President to two terms, but why only the President?  Being in any job too long can lead to complacency as well as possible corruption.  Serve your country for a time, and return to private life and live under the legislation you helped to fashion.  America does not need nor want a new ruling class.</p>

Amanda volunteered for the Boy Scouts of America, the Girl Scouts, and as an EMT at Polk County Fire District No. 1. In 2012, Amanda was diagnosed with Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy (RSD) following a work-related injury. Since diagnosis, she has become a relentless advocate for chronic pain, patients, and disability rights.
 
Amanda has dedicated her life to improving her community and tries to teach her son, Keagan, to do the same. Since high school, she has been marching for police reform, immigrant rights, LGBTQ rights, government reform, women's rights, and more. In 2016, she traveled to Standing Rock to stand with Water Protectors against the Dakota Access Pipeline. In her free time, Amanda tutors and mentors local kids.

				<p class=""survey-question"">Do you believe that it's beneficial for representatives to have previous experience in government or politics?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">No.

I believe that we learn by doing. All working in Congress is, is large scale community organizing. If you can work with people, have a passion for change, and a desire to make that happen then you should qualify. Our founding fathers had no background in politics yet they founded our country.</p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">Do you believe that two years is the right term length for representatives?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">No. It should be 4.  But after two 4-year terms you should be done in that office. Campaigning every 2 years makes it so all they are doing is campaigning and no work can get done.</p>
			</div>

			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">

				<p class=""survey-question"">Both sitting representatives and candidates for office hear many personal stories from the residents of their district. Is there a story that you’ve heard that you found particularly touching, memorable, or impactful?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">So many!!

The whole reason I'm running is because of those personal stories people have taken the time to tell me. 

Patients who have lost pain management or don't qualify for benefits
Benefits that are too low and lead to homelessness
Patients suffering without care
Workers struggling to find a job

I'm listening and hear them all. They all impact me.</p>

					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Who do you look up to? Whose example would you like to follow, and why?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Satoru Iwata was the former President of Nintendo and he didn't act like a company president; he would program games himself when his development teams were having trouble. When the company was faced with financial troubles, he cut his own salary in half to avoid laying off any employees. A true leader doesn't stand above his people, he stands underneath his people and elevates them to success.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Is there a book, essay, film, or something else you would recommend to someone who wants to understand your political philosophy?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">The Lego Movie: A humble worker who is completely fine with the status quo is radicalized by an outsider and realizes that he's been living in an authoritarian corporate regime. He learns that everyone is special and has the power to bring about change. Individualism and imagination are things to be embraced.</p>

			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What legacy would you like to leave?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I don't want to leave office until the US is operating on 100% clean energy, the unnecessary wars have been ended, everyone has health care, minimum wage is tied to inflation, sex work is decriminalized, drugs are decriminalized, UBI is implemented, and worker's cooperatives are the new normal business model. I aim high.</p>

					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What is the first historical event that happened in your lifetime that you remember? How old were you at the time?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">My parents must have shielded me from 9/11, because I don't remember the day. But I do remember the following year, 9/11/2002. I was 7 years old at the time. I remember other kids saying it was ""the bad day.""</p>

					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What is your favorite holiday? Why?</p>

			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What is your favorite book? Why?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Lamb: The Gospel According to Biff, Christ's Childhood Pal.

It's a comedy adventure about the ""missing years"" of Jesus told from the point of view of his friend Biff as they travel from Jerusalem to China to learn from spiritual leaders across the East. 

I'm a big fan of theology and historical fiction and the characters are just so heartwarming and funny.</p>

			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What qualities does the U.S. House of Representatives possess that makes it unique as an institution?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">It's where laws are born. A representative has the ability to take what they hear from constituents and write it into a law. If we can replace congress with honest people, the presidency will become less relevant.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Do you believe that it's beneficial for representatives to have previous experience in government or politics?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">No. I think having people in congress from all walks of life is important. Life-long politicians continue the oligarchic rule.</p>

					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">If you are not currently a member of your party’s leadership in the U.S. House of Representatives, would you be interested in joining the leadership? If so, in what role?</p>

			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Is there a particular representative, past or present, whom you want to model yourself after?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Nope. I'll just be like myself.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Both sitting representatives and candidates for office hear many personal stories from the residents of their district. Is there a story that you’ve heard that you found particularly touching, memorable, or impactful?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Hearing from people who can't afford their medicine is always hard. Hearing from parents about how their kids in the military were killed is unacceptable. I see homeless vets on the street every day. There's so much unnecessary suffering.</p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">What would be your top three priorities, if elected?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Â· Economic opportunity: Nevada families should have a fair shot at a good-paying career, the ability to safely raise a family, and a dignified retirement. Southern Nevada has long had a boom-bust economic cycle that has left families vulnerable when recessions hit, and we need to do more to diversify our economy and provide good-paying, middle-class jobs that pay the bills. That means strengthening our apprenticeship programs and vocational training, committing to affordable higher education, and taking forward-thinking steps to bring clean energy, infrastructure, and technology investments to Nevada.

Â· Education: I have spent the better part of 20 years working with Nevada students, teachers, administrators, and community partners to improve educational outcomes for vulnerable students as the leader of nonprofits like After-School All-Stars and Communities in Schools. I know firsthand how important a good education is to achieving the American dream, and I will fight to provide a strong education to every Nevada student. I will push for increased funding for early childhood education and expanded Pell Grants and college affordability programs. I'll also fight to strengthen apprenticeship programs and vocational training because people should be able to lead a middle-class life without a 4-year degree.

Â· Health Care: For too long, politicians have been playing partisan games with people's health care. I do not support taking away health care from Americans to advance a partisan agenda. Instead, I will focus on taking commonsense steps to protect access to health coverage, while bringing down costs. We must focus on lowering prescription drug prices by advocating increased transparency in pharmaceutical pricing and allowing Medicare to negotiate prescription drug prices. We need to find common ground to gets costs under control and expand access to health care. We also need to focus on expanding mental health services in Nevada.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What areas of public policy are you personally passionate about?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I am passionate about education, and I have a 25-year history of helping students succeed in our state. A good public education made all the difference in my life, and I believe that all students should leave school ready for the jobs of tomorrow. Today, too many students don't have that same opportunity, and it's why I've been fighting to fix our public schools. Education is the great equalizer, and we must ensure every student has a chance to succeed in school.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What qualities do you possess that you believe would make you a successful officeholder?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">My career has been about getting results, and this led me to work with partners across our state, regardless of what their party affiliation was. Fighting for our children just shouldn't be a partisan issue. When the Clark County School District cut funding for after-school programs, I became Founding Director of the Inner-City Games, which still exists as the After-School All-Stars and each day serves over 7,000 kids. In 2010, I became President of Communities In Schools of Nevada (CIS), taking on the dropout crisis in our state. Today, CIS serves over 67,000 students in 63 schools, achieving a graduation rate of 87% in those schools. My entire career, I've gotten results, and I plan on taking that same approach to Washington.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What was your very first job? How long did you have it?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">My first job was delivering newspapers in Canton, Ohio. My brother, sisters and I delivered papers to much of our community. I held this job for about five years until I was old enough to earn extra cash by babysitting and lifeguarding. These jobs were instrumental in teaching me the value of responsibility, hard work and being fiscally responsible. As a young child, I had to deliver papers every single day, collect customer's weekly payments and make sure I paid the newspaper company on time. These were valuable lessons that helped me throughout my life.</p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">What areas of public policy are you personally passionate about?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I'm most passionate about policies that affect our rural poor. Right now I'm focusing on Healthcare, improving infrastructure and combating poverty. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Who do you look up to? Whose example would you like to follow, and why?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I look up to Dolly Parton. I always joke with people that she's the patron saint of poor children, and that I could probably write a book about it.  A few reasons that I believe she is worth emulating: she has razor-sharp business acumen, her compassion towards communities that have historically been underrepresented, her acceptance of everyone. Seriously, I could talk a while about Dolly. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Is there a book, essay, film, or something else you would recommend to someone who wants to understand your political philosophy?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Growing up, I used comic books as an escape. I would usually be able to talk my mom into letting me get a couple at the thrift stores where the old issues were often 25 or 50 cents. I clung to Spider-Man's story and the idealistic view that he had of the world. Peter was a hero regardless of how little money he had, or how terrible things were in his personal life.  Recently I've been enjoying Miles Morales as he grows into his role as Spider-Man. I remember his quote that plays on the old Uncle Ben quote.  'The people around us are our great responsibility.'</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What is the first historical event that happened in your lifetime that you remember? How old were you at the time?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">The first historical event that I remember with clarity is the Siege at Waco. I would have been almost 4 at the time and I remember watching it on TV with my parents. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What was your very first job? How long did you have it?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Growing up, I had worked a number of odd jobs including mowing lawns, baling hay and umpiring baseball games.  My birthday present from my mother, when I turned sixteen, was a tax-paying job washing dishes at Steak n Shake I kept that job for 2 years , eventually working up to the breakfast cook on the weekends.  I had to wake up at 4 am to get to work at 5 on the weekends.  I still make a mean pancake. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What is your favorite book? Why?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">My favorite book series is the Lord of the Rings. It's a good way to soak up a day and get deep in a very thought out world. Always a fun read!</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">If you could be any fictional character, who would you want to be?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I think it would neat to be Iron Man.  His intellect is amazing, and it would be awesome to fly around in a hi-tech suit!</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What was the last song that got stuck in your head?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Truth Hurts- Lizzo</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What is something that has been a struggle in your life?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">My family didn't have a whole lot while I was growing up. We struggled with poverty, food insecurity, and were briefly homeless.  That said, those were not the biggest struggles that I've had to face. 

My biggest struggle is talking with a doctor about my father's medical needs, knowing that he can't afford it, and knowing that I can't afford to give it to him. The next biggest is knowing that we lost time with him due to that inability to cover those expenses.

I'm fighting to make sure that no other Missourian has to make those decisions.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Do you believe that it's beneficial for representatives to have previous experience in government or politics?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I believe that our representatives should be able to legislate for the struggles and needs of our people. Our founding fathers were very careful to leave out requirements for prior government experience because they believed that people had the ability to choose anyone to represent them, not just select from a pool of insiders.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What do you perceive to be the United States’ greatest challenges as a nation over the next decade?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I believe that our greatest challenge in the coming decade is the lack of unity with our country. We face a number of challenges that can only be solved by actual good-faith conversations toward a solution. We're going to have to face climate change, the rural/urban divide,  income inequality, gun violence, and growing our middle class.  We will not make any discernible progress on any of these issues until we address our lack of unity.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What are your thoughts on term limits?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I believe that we need to have term limits in place so that we can have a replenishment of ideas and experiences. I think that it's very problematic to have Representatives that have been serving in the same role for over 40 years. I'd like to see a term limit of 10 years enacted in order to keep these new ideas coming to forefront so that our country can progress. </p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">What would be your top three priorities, if elected?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">1. CLEAN GOVERNMENT: I believe in a government that facilitates the life you deserve and is built on this fundamental principle: For You, By You. Today the life you live is governed by self-serving silos of centralized government, economy, and health, which are designed For the Establishment, By the Establishment. But the life you deserve will emerge when you have a personalized and decentralized government, economy, and health that is For the People, By the People. And that can only emerge when you Declare Your Independence from the duopoly of Democrats and Republicans.

REAL HEALTH:  I would focus on three elements: 1) LOWERING THE COST of healthcare by eliminating kickbacks driven by group purchasing organizations (GPOs)/pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) -- middlemen who monopolize the supply chain and in aggregate have increased costs by a quarter of a trillion dollars; 2) Enabling innovation in drug development, which I know intimately. My company CytoSolve has a powerful technology to develop medicines faster and cheaper by modeling diseases using computational methods; and, 3) Incentivizing prevention and the eating of healthy food, including enacting policies to ensure our food supply is safe and not ridden with pesticides or genetic modifications that have evaded safety assessments.  Health is a complex systems problem, and solutions to complex systems problems deserve a multi-pronged approach. My solution can bring down the cost of healthcare, currently at $10,000 per worker, to $2,500 per worker.

3. REAL JOBS: In Massachusetts, for every 17 skilled job openings there is only one person skilled enough to fill the job. The way to address and truly fight inequality is by unleashing vo-tech schools in underserved areas to create more plumbers, electricians, and engineers. And beyond just Silicon Valley or Kendall Square, let's create 21st century jobs that take advantage of the incredible advances in science, engineering, medicine, and the long-awaited return of manufacturing and fair trade practices.</p>

					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What areas of public policy are you personally passionate about?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I embody the spirit of America. I came to America in 1970 from India, where we were considered low-caste ""Untouchables,"" or Deplorables.  My grandmother, who influenced me greatly, was a village healer.  My journey to America involved immigration, education and innovation.  I went through the public school system in New Jersey, where I mowed lawns, played baseball, and excelled in school.  In New Jersey I invented the world's first email system, when I wrote 50,000 lines of software code to convert the old-fashioned interoffice mail system (inbox, outbox, attachments, memo, etc.) to its electronic equivalent.  I named it ""email"" and received the first U.S. Copyright for Email, at a time when Copyright was the only way to protect software inventions. I went on to MIT to earn four degrees, including my PhD in systems biology -- which allowed me, via a Fulbright Scholarship, to integrate my training in systems biology with the traditional medicine of my grandmother.  Since coming to America, I have started seven companies and created jobs across Massachusetts.  Given my background, I am passionate about innovation, health care, education, and complex systems thinking in governance.  And I am one of you -- a hard worker, inventor, entrepreneur, problem solver and American. It's time we elected one of US to create the life we deserve.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What characteristics or principles are most important for an elected official?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">The Founders of this great country were soldiers, farmers, engineers, plumbers, blacksmiths, etc. They were not career politicians or lawyer-lobbyists -- they had skills and solved problems. Politicians and lawyers' business model is to never solve problems. In fact, they make more money the longer a problem is NOT solved.  That's why I would support term limits for all elected officials.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What qualities do you possess that you believe would make you a successful officeholder?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I have a proven track record of understanding problems, and actually solving problems.  I have four degrees from MIT, including my PhD.  I have been a serial entrepreneur, starting multiple and successful high-tech companies.  Most importantly, I have been a political activist throughout my life.  I fought to secure workers' rights at MIT, including poor black and white people.  I burned the South African flag to protest MIT's investments there during Apartheid.  I protested against the War in Iraq.  I have a unique talent stack of education, complex systems thinking, entrepreneurship, and political activism that makes me well qualified to be a U.S. Senator for the the 21st century.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What do you believe are the core responsibilities for someone elected to this office?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Solve problems in a decentralized, self-organizing matter that democratizes power within the people.  This means I would encourage free speech and discourse among the people.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What legacy would you like to leave?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Innovation doesn't come from a centralized, fragile military-academic-industrial complex; it comes from everyday people coming up with antifragile ways to improve the lives of each other.  And my election to the U.S. Senate means that any hard working, everyday American like me can and should serve in public office and then return to their private lives and family.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What qualities does the U.S. Senate possess that makes it unique as an institution?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">The ability to serve a 6-year term.  Six years is enough to effect real change in our body politic.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Do you believe that it’s beneficial for senators to have previous experience in government or politics?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">It is important for senators to have skills and be activists in politics, but it is absolutely unimportant for senators to be career politicians and lawyer-lobbyists.</p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">Who are you? Tell us about yourself in 300 words or less.</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Lynda Bennett is a true Constitutional conservative who lives and works in Haywood County.

Lynda is a hard working small business owner and free market advocate. She has been in the real estate industry for 33 years as a broker and owner manager with her husband Pat Bennett.

She will request to join the House Freedom Caucus on day one to continue the legacy of Mark Meadows as President Trump's biggest ally in Congress  and because there is strength in numbers to protect our constitutional rights. 

This election is not between red and blue  - it is between two world views. One would implement socialist policies to fundamentally change America forever. They believe that the government can and should control all aspects of our lives. Lynda will not allow that to happen. 

The conservative worldview believes that our rights come from God and are protected by the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. These rights are worth fighting for so that our children and their children can understand true freedom.

Lynda has served in the NC Republican Party and District 11 Executive Boards and as the Vice-chair of the Haywood County Republican Party.  She is actively engaged with the Heritage Foundation and the Sentinel program, along with Freedom Works and other grassroots conservative organizations.

Lynda is not a politician. She is a fighter and will be a strong representative for the people&nbsp;of western North Carolina.</p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">Please list below 3 key messages of your campaign. What are the main points you want voters to remember about your goals for your time in office?</p>
				<ul class=""key-messages"">
					<li>Pro-Trump</li>
					<li>Pro-2nd Amendment gun rights</li>
					<li>Pro-Life</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
							<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What areas of public policy are you personally passionate about?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">- Implement an America First Agenda that builds an economy based on free markets and less government regulations so that the American Dream can be fully enjoyed by all citizens, of all backgrounds, and all walks of life.

- Protecting the Bill of Rights. The Right to Life is one of the basic functions of government. The second amendment protects all the other rights in the Constitution .

</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Who do you look up to? Whose example would you like to follow, and why?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Mark Meadows uses his voting card for the people of North Carolina not for Special Interests or Congressional leadership. He stands as one of the President's biggest supporters.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Is there a book, essay, film, or something else you would recommend to someone who wants to understand your political philosophy?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Ayn Rand  'Atlas Shrugged'.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What characteristics or principles are most important for an elected official?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">A tough skin - there is no decision that can be made that everyone will agree with. Empathy will help to understand both sides. Ability to make a decision using the available information. Negotiating skills because as we have seen with President Trump  - it is important to make good deals. 

To use the Constitution as our guiding document. The principles found in the Constitution are based on Judeo-Christian principles that have stood the test of time. Our rights come from God  - not from the government -  and are protected by the Constitution. We have a Republic if we can keep it. 

There are limited duties given to the federal government the remainder of government responsibilities are to be handled by the states and local governments or up to the people themselves.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What do you believe are the core responsibilities for someone elected to this office?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Constituent services - helping people in the district to deal with the agencies of the federal government. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What was your very first job? How long did you have it?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I was a baby sitter - when I first started working. Then I worked at McDonalds and rode my bicycle to work as a waitress in a neighborhood cafe - all before the age of 16.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Do you believe that it's beneficial for representatives to have previous experience in government or politics?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">My experience in the real estate industry is similar to the experience of two of my favorite politicians. Mark Meadows and President Trump both came out of the real estate industry and they never served a day in public office prior to being elected. I am following in their footsteps.



</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What do you perceive to be the United States’ greatest challenges as a nation over the next decade?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Our Freedom is at stake... not from an invading army that would unite us in the fight but from a force from within our nation that is actually dividing us. The people that work every day to make America great, that are law abiding and take care of their responsibilities and their families are being forced to pay for things in the government that are unconstitutional and that they oppose on moral principle. They watch as their God given rights are threatened. Yet the people that are breaking the law or gaming the system go free or collect benefits. Restoring Patriotism in our youth.  Fighting Socialism.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What are your thoughts on term limits?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I support term limits. Three terms for the House and two terms for the Senate.</p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">Who are you? Tell us about yourself in 300 words or less.</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">i served our nation for 30 years in the United States Marine Corps, retiring at the rank of Colonel. I am  decorated combat fighter pilot and flew in over 75 combat missions during Operation Desert Storm, Southern Watch &amp; Restore Hope. I was then promoted to a F/A-18 Hornet Fighter Squadron Commanding Officer aboard the USS Abraham Lincoln. I was then asked to serve as the Chief of Staff for the White House Military Office.  Education is also important to me, and I have earned multiple degrees including a Master's Degree from the National Defense University, a BS from Arizona State University in Business and a BA from California State University, Fullerton in History and Political Science.  I have been part of the Orange County community for many years and am blessed to call this place home. I came to Mission Viejo in 1978 as a young First Lieutenant, where I was assigned to the 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing at the Marine Corps Air Station in El Toro. During this time, I met and married Luci, and together we have three children and six grandchildren. Since retiring from the United States Marine Corps, I have continued my service and dedication to those who have served. I currently serve as Vice-Chairman of the Orange County Veterans Advisory Council, where I am able to assist veterans in my local community.  I was first elected to the Mission Viejo City Council in 2014, and re-elected in 2018. In 2019, I am proud to have been unanimously appointed by my colleagues on the Mission Viejo City Council to Mayor.  I am also a member of many community organizations including President of the Mission Viejo Rotary Club, Charter member of the Mission Viejo Chamber of Commerce, Mission Viejo Elks Lodge 2444, Mission Viejo VFW Post 6024, American Legion Post 291, OSO Valley Greenbelt HOA Board-member, St. Kilian's Knights of Columbus Council 6332, Association of Naval Aviation, Marine Corps Aviation Association, and UniteOC Toastmasters.</p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">Who do you look up to? Whose example would you like to follow, and why?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I greatly admire President Theodore Roosevelt. His 'Arena Speech' are words that I live by to this day. 'It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.'</p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">What characteristics or principles are most important for an elected official?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">'Service before self' is the motto that I live by. I believe that our representatives are supposed to have the best interests of their constituents in mind when making critical decisions. I do not care for party politics, and I will stand firmly behind what I believe is best for my constituents and the American people. I have an open door policy and when I am elected, I will always be sure to provide a voice to the residents of Orange County in Washington, D.C.</p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">What do you perceive to be the United States’ greatest challenges as a nation over the next decade?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Some of our most pressing issues over the next decade include our relationship with China, our growing national debt, Social Security insolvency, maintaining control over our borders, and automation of common workforce positions. I am an optimist and I believe that with great challenges, come great achievements. It is my goal to be able to extend an olive branch to those in congress and work together with the legislature to address these issues. These issues should not be partisan issues, and we should not be leaving future generations strapped with the burden of our shortcomings.</p>

					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">If you are not a current representative, are there certain committees that you would want to be a part of?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I would love to help veterans by sitting on the Veterans Affairs committee. I would also be a great fit for the Homeland Security Committee, Armed Services Committee, Foreign Affairs Committee, and Natural Resources Committee. My background as a United States Marine Corps Colonel along with my National Security experience makes me uniquely qualified to sit on any of these committees.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What are your thoughts on term limits?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I am a strong supporter of term limits and have recently signed a pact to encourage legislators to support term limits. I believe that U.S. House of Representatives should be limited to three terms and U.S. Senators should be limited to two terms. If elected, I promise to only serve at a maximum of three terms.</p>

				<p class=""survey-response"">""As a United States Marine, I served this GREAT Nation with honor, courage, and commitment. I have the required skill sets needed to get Congress back on track. I have led, trained, and educated over 5,000 United States Marines. I coordinated with local National Security Forces that work hand and hand with our Military. District 13 has been neglected and unheard of for far too long. It's time we have a true American represent us, not someone that believes the seat owes them. I will work for you. When elected, I will ensure Congress remembers they are here for the people, not themselves. We need to create more living-wage jobs, improve our schools, and make public safety - especially getting drugs off the streets, a top priority. With nearly over a decade of government experience, I know what it takes to find solutions, navigate the complicated governmental agencies, and get things done.

				<p class=""survey-question"">Who are you? Tell us about yourself in 300 words or less.</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">My name is Tariq Shabazz. I was born and raised in the inner-city of Cleveland Ohio. As an adolescent I have witnessed an immense number of atrocities that ranged from illegal drug distribution, gang activity, to gun violence. Throughout this time period it sparked the fire of aspirations to have a life in public service.

I joined the United States Navy in 2014 as a Aviation Electronics Technician. In my tenure I have been awarded 2 Navy Marine Corps Achievement Medals; 1 Good Conduct medal, 1 Sailor of the Year and received an honorable discharge in September 2019. I have dedicated my life to creating public policy that will benefit Americans that have suffered for far too long.

							<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What areas of public policy are you personally passionate about?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Health care must be accessible and affordable to everyone, but this requires an openness to innovative solutions and creative dialog among all players including insurers, pharmaceutical companies, health providers, civic society, media, tech partners, and patients.

Building working models of prosperity within our local economy. The key to creating jobs, creating wealth, and bringing down taxes is thinking locally.

The environment, with climate change at the center, and including clean air, clean water, and access to healthy food, must be pre-requisites for a better future for our community.</p>

The current Congressman for my Congressional District, Chris Smith, has had a reign of 39 years. This is shameful, and limits the district's ability to be rejuvenated by fresh ideas.

				<p class=""survey-response"">I hear powerful stories every day. Just the other day I spoke with a 92 year old woman on the phone who lives in Lakewood, and she sang a song to me that she sang for Queen Elizabeth as a girl on her way from Poland to New Jersey as a Holocaust survivor. I've heard stories from teachers who buy books for their classes because the school system has no budget, from a man in Neptune City who mourned the loss of wildlife in the Shark River due to climate change, a 74 year old African American mayor in our district who was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, telling me that 20% of the cost of his surgery and chemo treatment were not covered by his Medicare policy. There is no end to the stories. I have a lot of positive ones too!

				<p class=""survey-question"">Who are you? Tell us about yourself in 300 words or less.</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Skylar Hurwitz is a technology entrepreneur and environmentalist born and raised in Bucks County, Pennsylvania. He split his youth equally between Yardley and New Hope-Solebury, worked in Washington, DC for nearly a decade, and has been running a small business in his hometown since 2018. As one of four boys raised by a single mother, he immediately recognized how out of touch our nation's leadership is with the challenges of the modern day working and middle class. His time in DC provided key insights into what is broken in Washington - and what must be done to fix the government so it starts working for everyday Americans again.  Skylar gained experience working directly on Capitol Hill briefly serving in the office of Congresswoman Carolyn B. Maloney of New York and working on a SunShot initiative grant at the National Association of Regional Councils that focused on lowering the bureaucratic costs of solar installations.  Skylar then spent nearly three years managing a $30 million grant portfolio and doing extensive international travel for Conservation International in Arlington, Virginia. The program protected the most vulnerable biodiverse regions on Earth by building the capacity of locals in those countries to manage problems self-sufficiently.   This campaign is about uniting for a Fair Tax Platform that protects our planet and provides a more secure future for every American. Every policy proposed by this campaign can be paid for in a way that increases the annual disposable income for individuals making $250,000 or less and couples making $500,000 or less. Together, we can provide all Americans with a baseline level of security and stability that makes our communities safer. </p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">Please list below 3 key messages of your campaign. What are the main points you want voters to remember about your goals for your time in office?</p>
				<ul class=""key-messages"">
					<li>Together, we will restore faith and trust in our government with a Fair Tax Platform that puts American workers first. </li>
					<li>As the job creators become automators, it is time corporations like Amazon begin paying their fair share in taxes like the rest of us. </li>
					<li>It's time our foreign policy focused on building allies and security through cooperation around shared challenges, not dropping bombs because of our differences.</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
							<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What areas of public policy are you personally passionate about?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">You and your family pay taxes each year, so why are companies like Amazon and Walmart paying 0% in taxes while their trucks use our public infrastructure and their workers rely on federal benefits to survive? On top of that, 2018 was the first year the top 400 individual earners in this country paid less in taxes than the middle class. Our campaign will fight to change the federal tax code so that large corporations stop draining federal resources and begin paying their fair share in taxes.

Quietly, Wall Street speculators are using computer programs to make lightning fast transactions that destabilize our financial system. Our campaign will introduce a speculative trading tax to these types of transactions on Wall Street.

By introducing fair tax policies that level the playing field and target risky behavior, our campaign will secure the funding necessary to implement every one of these platform proposals to protect working class Americans while combatting the national debt. Under our platform, individuals making up to $250,000 and couples making up to $500,000 jointly would see an increase in their annual disposable income and would benefit from our campaign's objectives of eliminating electricity bills by 2035, letting you access any doctor you want and eliminating medical debt and all health insurance premiums, copays, and deductibles by 2025 and providing healthy school meals and a complete education from pre-k through 4-year public college/trade school.</p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">What would be your top three priorities, if elected?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">My top three priorities are improving healthcare coverage for Montanans, creating more high-paying jobs, and protecting Montana's natural heritage.

1) HEALTHCARE: As I have traveled across the state, the top priority voters shared with me was fixing our healthcare system. I have developed a detailed plan to provide affordable, quality healthcare for all Montanans. This plan will stabilize the individual market and move to truly universal coverage while reducing out of pocket costs for Montanans. I will also fight to protect Medicaid, Medicare, and Social Security.

2) JOBS: I will create more high-paying jobs for Montana residents, and fix the tax code to be fair to working-class families. In the legislature, I fought to defend Montana's small businesses and to create jobs, which helped Montana recover from the Great Recession. I have helped farmers and ranchers stay on their land and keep their land productive. I am also committed to addressing increasing income disparity in Montana through a more fair tax code that does not provide giveaways to the rich.

3) OUTDOOR HERITAGE: I will preserve access to Montana's public lands, and fight for environmental protections to keep Montana beautiful for future generations. Throughout my 35-year career in outdoor recreation and natural resources, I have brokered win-win solutions to thorny issues across a variety of landscapes and issues. In the Legislature, I stood up to nefarious proposals to transfer public lands and fought to keep public land open to all Montana citizens, unlike my opponent. I also favor bipartisan approaches to address climate change that will keep Montana safe for future generations while enabling local businesses to grow.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What areas of public policy are you personally passionate about?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I care deeply about providing better, more affordable healthcare to Montana's citizens. As I travel across the state meeting voters, healthcare is the top issue people told me they cared about.

Healthcare is personal for me as well. When I was 11 years old, my mother, Marie, started to lose her memory. When Marie got lost driving, I rode her bike out to find her and help her get home. Marie was diagnosed with early onset Alzheimer's. My father and I became her caregivers for the next seven years. I personally know what a healthcare crisis can do to a family. Fixing our broken healthcare system is my top priority.

In the Montana Legislature I had success on difficult healthcare issues. I crafted a law requiring insurers to make life-saving cancer treatment affordable. It took four years, it was tough, but it saved lives.

I plan to bring that experience to Congress to fix our national healthcare system. I have a detailed, achievable plan to immediately reduce costs for Montanans. It will stabilize the individual market and move to truly universal coverage. I will fight for the following:

--Reinstating payments to insurers and individuals to keep the cost of individual plans down.

--Making CHIP and the federal rural health center fund a permanent part of our healthcare system, not political footballs that get renewed every two or six years.

--Lifting the restriction that prevents Medicare from bargaining for drug prices, allowing it to lower consumer costs through price negotiations, like Medicaid and the VA can do today.

--Allowing people 55 and older to buy into Medicare, setting the stage to transform our healthcare system in a cost-effective, achievable way.

--Devoting federal resources to combating the methamphetamine and opioid crisis.

--Protecting Medicaid, Medicare, and Social Security.</p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">Who do you look up to? Whose example would you like to follow, and why?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Dick Knox was a Republican legislator from Winifred I met when he chaired the Natural Resources Committee for which I was staff. He would stay until every member of the public had a chance to say their piece, no matter how late or who they were. He was an incredible family man. He passed away part way through my second session as staff. At his memorial I sang his favorite hymn ""His Eye is on the Sparrow."" I so respected him for the example he set that all Montanans deserve to be heard.</p>

					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What qualities do you possess that you believe would make you a successful officeholder?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I have significant political experience working to pass legislation with colleagues of all political stripes. My career working on outdoors issues in Montana trained me on how to bring together different types of people and organizations to reach solutions that benefit our state. Being able to work with diverse partners ultimately helped me pass more legislation to benefit Montana's citizens.
Finally, I care deeply about voters' concerns, and have spent weeks traveling across the state in my camper to hear from citizens of every background. This deep connection to the people of Montana will help me pass laws that best address all of our needs.</p>

					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What is your favorite book? Why?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Dancing at the Rascal Fair by Ivan Doig. It's a timeless book about Montana, history, family, grit, forests, and agriculture. This book was also one of my late husband Tom's favorite books, which impressed me mightily about him.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Do you believe that it's beneficial for representatives to have previous experience in government or politics?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I think some previous government experience helps since it gives you a real window into how different agencies work. My time serving in the Montana State Legislature has taught me how to work with different agencies to help Montana families.</p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">Who are you? Tell us about yourself in 300 words or less.</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Kirk Troen is a veteran, business owner, community volunteer, educator, hard-working taxpayer, and devoted dad.

Kirk proudly served our nation in the United States Marine Corps.

Nothing has ever been handed to Kirk. He learned about hard work at an early age. Kirk was the first member of his family to graduate from college. After a semester of juggling a full-time job and school, Kirk enlisted in the United States Marine Corps and went to school on the GI Bill.

Understanding the importance of education, Kirk eventually earned an Associate of Arts degree, a Bachelor of Arts degree, and two Master of Science degrees.

After serving our nation, Kirk continued his public service by teaching music in a middle school for 4 years. He was elected to the Prince William County Education Association Board of Directors and served as a teacher mentor.

In 2004, he opened his own business that produced music events, including a music festival held at the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. Presently, he is the managing director for Super Holiday Tours.

Over his lifetime, Kirk has been involved in numerous charitable organizations helping raise funds. Being involved has been in his fabric since he was very young. Most recently, he has supported the Wounded Warfighter Lone Sailor and Wake for Warriors.

It is now time to be a part of the solution of fixing Washington and stopping inadequate representation. </p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">Please list below 3 key messages of your campaign. What are the main points you want voters to remember about your goals for your time in office?</p>
				<ul class=""key-messages"">
					<li>We need to reform the Immigration system to allow only those that cross legally into the country.</li>
					<li>Medicare for All is a proposal that will eliminate private health care for 150 million Americans</li>
					<li>We cannot accept socialist ideology. This will destroy our economy and way of life.</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
							<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What areas of public policy are you personally passionate about?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">The quote ""no one is above the law"" is rampant among Democrats. We need policies that enforce all laws on all that violate the law. Crossing the border at a point other than a port of entry is breaking the law, working under an assumed social security number is breaking the law, not cooperating with ICE and the Border Patrol is breaking the law. But all of these are laws that some politicians want to ignore and let the law breakers become ""above the law"". </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Who do you look up to? Whose example would you like to follow, and why?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I look up to many Marine leaders that are both historical figures and those that I served with. They all served with honor, integrity and a passion for America and it's people. I would like to follow in those leaders footsteps and make a mark on helping promote the American Dream.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What characteristics or principles are most important for an elected official?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Leadership and Empathy are critical for a successful representative. A good representative must be able to work and coordinate many people from different backgrounds, religious beliefs, and ethnicities. We have to come together as Americans and work for the common goal of happiness and success. While working towards these goals, we have to be able to empathize with people of different economic and cultural backgrounds. Understanding is key to good leadership.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What qualities do you possess that you believe would make you a successful officeholder?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I am a successful and strong leader that is capable of bringing people together to accomplish the goals and desires of the group. I am a patriot that has a dedication to this country that only Marines possess. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What do you believe are the core responsibilities for someone elected to this office?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Listening to what the constituents want, while balancing the differing opinions to come up with solutions that include every ""side"" of the issue. We cannot alienate a group of people because their opinions differ from our own.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What legacy would you like to leave?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">One of leadership and accomplishment making life better for those that I serve.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What is the first historical event that happened in your lifetime that you remember? How old were you at the time?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">My first memory is watching my sister learn to drive when I was six. She couldn't master the clutch and thus could not get out of the driveway. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What was your very first job? How long did you have it?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">My first job was at age 11 delivering the morning newspaper. I worked every morning without exception for two years. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What is your favorite book? Why?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">The Four Hour Work Week. It gave insights of how people can be productive and incredibly resourceful by just putting some thought into the daily routine.</p>
			</div>

				<p class=""survey-response"">Wonderful World - Louis Armstrong</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What is something that has been a struggle in your life?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Connecting on a deep personal level with others. I tend to keep  my personal feelings to myself, and do not share my personal struggles with others. My outlook is positive and optimistic, so in times of personal conflict or emotion, I keep those feelings close.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What qualities does the U.S. House of Representatives possess that makes it unique as an institution?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">It is the branch of Congress that allows for every person in every state to have a voice in the direction of the Nation. The Representatives elected to the House represent smaller populations and are able to speak to a vast number of constituents personally.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Do you believe that it's beneficial for representatives to have previous experience in government or politics?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">No, however I believe that it is very beneficial for representatives to have much needed leadership experience and a variety of local and national levels. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What do you perceive to be the United States’ greatest challenges as a nation over the next decade?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">The greatest challenges appear to be getting politicians to listen to their constituents and doing the work of the country. If that occured, major issues such as mental health, immigration, foreign policy and economic growth could be pointed in the right direction without partisan bickering and politicians dictating what is best for Americans. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">If you are not a current representative, are there certain committees that you would want to be a part of?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I would like to be on the Armed Services Committee and the House Foreign Affairs Committee.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Do you believe that two years is the right term length for representatives?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Yes I do, and I also believe that there should be term limits of four terms. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What are your thoughts on term limits?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">If the President is restricted to eight years, then so should the rest of Congress. Too long in these positions and politicians become dictators to their districts and do not listen to their constituents. Additionally, there should be no retirement or lifetime benefits for serving only a few years. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">If you are not currently a member of your party’s leadership in the U.S. House of Representatives, would you be interested in joining the leadership? If so, in what role?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I am more interested in serving the people of Central Florida rather than a political party.</p>
			</div>

				<p class=""survey-question"">Who are you? Tell us about yourself in 300 words or less.</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I'm Jaimie Kulikowski. In January 2015, I started remembering, integrating, and reframing all the ways I was dissected into socially competitive identity intersections created by an oppressive and judgmental white male patriarchy. As the process comes full circle, I realize that all these intersections are how others see and judge me, but they no longer have control over how I see myself or lead my life.

Here is how others see me:

I'm privileged as a white person. I'm underprivileged as a woman. I'm privileged through the lens of lower economic classes. I'm underprivileged through the lens of upper economic classes. I'm privileged with a graduate degree. I'm underprivileged with a lot of wisdom and knowledge that came from inside me rather than a credentialed authority. I'm privileged because a test said I have an IQ above 130. I'm underprivileged because another test said I have panic disorder and severe anxiety. I'm privileged in my British Catholic ancestry. I'm underprivileged in my Polish Jewish ancestry. I'm privileged when I speak up for and defend others. I'm underprivileged when I speak for and defend myself. I could go on...

I no longer see myself as a two dimensional duality where part of me is on the side of privilege and the other part is on the side of underprivilege. I see myself as a body full of power and pain. I can feel both the power and pain in all my identity intersections now, and have finally put myself back together into one whole story.

I am running for office because: 1) I have training in being both a leader for war and a leader for words. 2) My personal story of identity integration is needed in the political arena,</p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">What is the first historical event that happened in your lifetime that you remember? How old were you at the time?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">During childhood, adolescence, and college, my world revolved around family, friends, boys, and community activities. I didn't pay attention to the news or world events, and they weren't topics of conversation around our dinner table either. 
  
The first historical event I was a part of was the Kosovo Peacekeeping mission in 2001. The Army came in to restore peace after the horrific genocide that took place during the Kosovo Conflict from 98-99. The memory of the genocide my Polish Jewish ancestors suffered during WWII did not arise in my blood until 2017.</p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">What qualities does the U.S. House of Representatives possess that makes it unique as an institution?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">It is not a unique organization yet. It is following in the footsteps of a very oppressive and outdated paradigm of white male supremacy.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Do you believe that it's beneficial for representatives to have previous experience in government or politics?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I believe the current political arena is a racist, sexist war zone. Therefore, representatives should have experience, not just in government, but in the military. As we start to shift away from a war era and into a peace era, it is also important for representatives to have experience in being both a leader and a follower. Representatives running in the democratic party should have experience following the leadership of those in marginalized identities. Most importantly, I believe representatives need to be authentic representations of themselves, not sitting in the House as a clone of the privileged white men who came before them. That then creates a ripple effect and makes the population they're leading become clones too.</p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">What areas of public policy are you personally passionate about?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Drug diversion programs my office continues to champion is an area where I have seen first-hand the positive impact on the lives of individuals who were written off prior to my tenure as District Attorney.  Far too often the criminal justice cycle is an infinite loop, but programs like these can actually help the addicted population recuperate, keeping them out of prisons, jails and making a lasting difference in their lives and in turn on the community as a whole. In turn, the recidivism rate will decrease, which will lower the taxpayers' burden on the trying and retrying people for similar non-violent drug offenses.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What characteristics or principles are most important for an elected official?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">A Member of Congress must embody the characteristics of their constituents. The people from my district are passionate, honest, respectful, hardworking and moral.  Having been born and raised in Northern New Mexico, I am grateful that my family and my community have taught me how to live by these values and I bring them with me in every endeavor I take in my life.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What is your favorite book? Why?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Elie Wiesel is an amazing writer that was capable of encapsulating over a decade of atrocities. Night, his own tale of a survivor during the Holocaust, is compelling and illustrates the absolute worst humanity has to offer. I have read it front to back more times than I can count, and we must never allow any nation's moral fiber to dissolve to such a capacity for violence.&nbsp;</p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">Who are you? Tell us about yourself in 300 words or less.</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Lisa Song Sutton is a businesswoman, an entrepreneur, an outspoken advocate for women, and Miss Nevada United States 2014.

Lisa started her first business, Sin City Cupcakes, out of her home kitchen over 7 years ago, and today it is an iconic Las Vegas treat that delights tens of thousands of locals and visitors each year. Lisa is also co-founder of Ship Las Vegas, Elite Homes - Christie's International Real Estate, and Liquid &amp; Lace swimwear.

In addition to her work as an entrepreneur, Lisa is an advocate for women, serving on the boards of local non-profits, encouraging representation for everyone. She has shared her message of empowerment and action with audiences from the TEDx stage to local schools, encouraging people, especially women, to take a seat at the table and make their voices heard.

Lisa's father is a U.S. Air Force veteran and her mother is a Korean-American immigrant. She is a strong supporter of our local veterans, active military and their families. This led her to open Ship Las Vegas, a mailbox and shipping store, near Nellis Air Force Base in North Las Vegas, where she saw firsthand the need for services.

Lisa knows what it means to work hard; she worked multiple part-time jobs in real estate and the modeling industry throughout college and law school and was the first Miss Nevada of Asian descent. During her campaign and year of service, she kept her promise to make the largest impact in the community that she could and conducted nearly 500 appearances in 18 months, volunteering in hospitals, reading in schools, and helping connect Nevadans to non-profit organizations that could improve their quality of life.</p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">Please list below 3 key messages of your campaign. What are the main points you want voters to remember about your goals for your time in office?</p>
				<ul class=""key-messages"">
					<li>I support the tax cuts, but we must curtail spending. The current budget is harmful to the American people. We cannot keep mortgaging our future and continue to raise the debt ceiling. I will not support increased taxation to aid a bloated government budget.</li>
					<li>As the daughter of a veteran of the Vietnam War, I see the issues first-hand. The men and women who have served our country deserve our appreciation and support. They should be treated with dignity and given resources to succeed.</li>
					<li>Our nation shares a great love of sporting heritage. In addition, personal and home protection, especially for women, is incredibly important. A firearm is one of the most efficient ways to equalize a life-threatening situation. More restrictive gun laws will have little effect on crime because by nature, criminals do not follow the law. I support our right to bear arms, and advocate firearm knowledge and safety training.</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
							<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What areas of public policy are you personally passionate about?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">A strong economy is essential to American prosperity. In order to keep our economy strong and continue growth, we must get government out of the way of business. Reducing business-killing regulations and harmful taxes are what the community wants and needs.</p>

				<ul class=""key-messages"">
					<li>I don't take big corporate money or super pac money. I am grassroots funded and firmly believe you can't change a corrupt system by taking it's money. We must get money out of politics and move to clean publicly financed elections now!</li>
					<li>Single Payer Healthcare is not a radical idea. The rest of the developed world has done one version or another of it and kicks out butts in terms of price and outcomes. Let's stop a mafia-like profit-driven health insurance industry from getting in-between you and your doctor to the tunes of over 100 billion annually and provide single payer medicare for all healthcare to all!</li>
					<li>When I watch any of the mainsteam media outlets on TV, I feel like it's opposite world. They act like any legislation that helps normal Americans is crazy and that things like endless war, tax breaks for the wealthy, corporate subsidies, and corrupting big money in our politics is just a no-brainer and it shouldn't even be questioned. I'm here to tell you that it's not crazy to do things for all Americans and I will fight for that much needed systematic change!</li>

				<p class=""survey-question"">Who are you? Tell us about yourself in 300 words or less.</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Rishi Kumar is a Silicon Valley hi-tech software executive, mechanical engineer by education, community activist and an elected leader of Saratoga. Rishi is an energetic proponent of data-driven solutions to deliver results ""cheaper, faster, better"" for his community. He brings the Silicon Valley hi-tech actionable, results driven mindset. As an IBM engineer, Rishi found his calling as an activist stepping up for complex community challenges that he couldn't ignore.  As a councilmember of Saratoga, he led efforts to reject San Jose Water company's rate increases and reduce burglaries - two of the top challenges. This led to his re-election with the most votes in Saratoga's election history.  Rishi's agenda as a fiscal moderate includes Climate Change, Healthcare, quality of life issues, housing, homelessness and traffic. Rishi brings a innovative problem-solving agenda with a ""21 minutes to 21 counties"" vision that expands our economy and addresses our issues with housing, homelessness and traffic logjams. A new vision for the future of Silicon Valley is needed. Rishi has the energy and a ""getting things done"" attitude.  Rishi has pledged to NEVER accept Special Interest Group or PAC money. Rishi and his wife Seema live in Saratoga with their two sons.</p>

					<li>Big Money in Politics: I have taken the pledge to not accept special interest money or PAC money and taken the ""No Health Insurance and Pharma Money Pledge"". https://rishikumar.com/Democrat-Rishi-Kumar-is-running-for-United-States-Congress-against-Congresswoman-Anna-Eshoo-and-seeks-to-take-the-Big-Money-out-of-Politics</li>
					<li>Healthcare reform is the imperative of our times. I will push back against burgeoning healthcare costs and rising drug prices, and will push for medicare for all. https://rishikumar.com/Democrat-Rishi-Kumar-running-for-United-States-Congress-against-Congresswoman-Anna-Eshoo-seeks-to-reduce-the-healthcare-cost-and-supports-Medicare-for-All</li>
					<li>Housing and Transportation are the top issues in Silicon Valley. The daily traffic jams, the housing crunch and the quality of life challenges have led to people and jobs exiting Silicon Valley. We need elected leaders who can address these challenges with a vision for a better future.  https://rishikumar.com/Mega-Silicon-Valley-Op-Ed-21-minutes-or-less-between-21-counties</li>

							<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What areas of public policy are you personally passionate about?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">- Global: Climate Change
- National: Healthcare
- Regional: Housing &amp; Homelessness, Transportation &amp; Infrastructure
- Local: Reduce Silicon Valley crime


</p><ul><li>Housing &amp; Transportation: Unaffordable housing and increasing traffic congestion are two critical issues facing Silicon Valley and the entire Bay Area. A high-speed transportation system connecting 21 counties based on a tunnel-based Hyperloop technology would create affordable housing and solve our traffic gridlock.  This would make a broad range of affordable housing options available to residents, and expand Silicon Valley's innovation success and economic growth throughout the region. https://rishikumar.com/Mega-Silicon-Valley-Op-Ed-21-minutes-or-less-between-21-counties</li></ul>

<ul><li>Healthcare: Big Pharma and health lobbyists have penetrated their way into our government. I support Medicare for All and am the only Democrat in this race to reject PAC and Special Interest Group money. It is time we explored healthcare options for the people of America. </li></ul>

					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Who do you look up to? Whose example would you like to follow, and why?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Dr. Martin Luther King is someone I have idolized ever since I was a little child. I respect his indomitable spirit and ability to step up and diligently pursue issues and challenges. Dr King never gave up. His steadfast approach was able to change the world. I have tried to emulate Dr King's leadership qualities and his zeal to do good in my role as a community activist and elected leader.</p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">What characteristics or principles are most important for an elected official?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">People-centric behavior is very important and that is currently lacking and has been relegated to the background. Our elected leaders should demonstrate a citizen-centric value system and restore trust into our democracy. Unfortunately, PAC money and Special Interest Group money is dominating American politics. Elected leaders who accept PAC and Special Interest money will never be able to truly represent the people. I will work to remove the big money influence on American politics. It is time we had fearless leaders who will make citizen-centric choices for the American people.
That is in fact my track record as an elected leader of Saratoga. We got the most votes in Saratoga's election history for stepping up and addressing the tough people challenges.

				<p class=""survey-question"">What qualities do you possess that you believe would make you a successful officeholder?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">**INNOVATION ECONOMY
I'm tired of seeing career politicians who are not aligned with Silicon Valley's innovation economy. Serious quality of life issues such as the housing and traffic are causing an exodus of Silicon Valley tech talent.

There are big changes coming. We must prepare the next generation to succeed in an autonomous world of artificial intelligence, machine learning, blockchain technology; we must lead the world in technological innovation! We need to seed Silicon Valley's innovation success to other parts of California and America, so that our working-class families share in the economic prosperity.

Data privacy, Net Neutrality and online security is a growing American concern. I support efforts such as The California Consumer Privacy Act and the Internet Bill of Rights.

I will partner with our tech leaders to develop synergies for Silicon Valley's sustained success. I am prepared to champion the needs of Silicon Valley in Washington

Corporate greed and Super PACs exert too much influence upon our political system. The voices of everyday Americans are not being heard. The American people see our government only open to large contributors and lobbyists, rather than working for them. Our elected leaders should not be bought and sold by big money.  I will work to remove the big money influence on American politics and restore trust in our democracy.

					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What is your favorite book? Why?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Eckhart Tolle's book, The Power of Now. The ability to be in the essence of the moment, and do your best at this moment has defined what I do. The present moment, where we can truly take charge in connecting with the inner self can create true happiness and an agenda of doing good. The ability to quiet the world is very uplifting and powerful. That is a daily practice for me and that is why this continues to be my favorite book.</p>

Silicon Valley needs tech savvy congressional leaders. I'm running for Congress because I'm tired of seeing career politicians who are not aligned with Silicon Valley's innovation economy.

				<p class=""survey-question"">If you are not a current representative, are there certain committees that you would want to be a part of?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">1) The House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure
2) Science, Space, and Technology 

(1) Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure: Silicon Valley powers the economy of California and of the United States. Investing in its infrastructure will pay tremendous dividends to all.  Look up my ""21 counties, 21 minutes Mega Silicon Valley vision."" We need bold transportation plans.This is America and we can innovate with transportation like no one can.

Faster, cheaper and better modes of transportation will pay huge dividends.  Building Light Rail, Bullet Train or expanding freeways and roads in urban communities is expensive, goes through litigation and not a scalable option.

We can start with ten corridors as potential recipients of federal fundin that includes California, Pacific Northwest. This is a new century and we have to invest in net new infrastructure for the next generation. The time is now.   I am interested in making a downpayment for a glorious future in American history.

(2) Science, Space, and Technology is a committee on which I can make a valuable contribution. I'm running for Congress because I'm tired of career politicians who don't understand Silicon Valley's innovation industry. We cannot prepare our workforce for an autonomous workplace built upon Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning if our leadership is technologically illiterate. My professional experience in Silicon Valley's software industry as a business and technology leader puts me in a unique position for Silicon Valley innovation to succeed and for the gains to spread to our middle class and working class families. We must prepare the next generation to succeed in a 21st century world. We need to create a system that delivers Silicon Valley's innovation prowess to other parts of California and America.We must not allow our nation to lose its place as the technology leader of the world.  The very future of American success and prosperity is at stake.</p>

					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What are your thoughts on term limits?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Our  Founding Fathers feared the creation of a permanent political class that existed parallel to, rather than enmeshed within, American society.\"" Several lawmakers have brought back the old idea of congressional term limits to \""drain the swamp\"" on Capitol Hill with  a constitutional amendment to limit the number of times a legislator can run for re-election to the same office. 

What do we have today? American politics has career politicians who stay in office for decades and treat their office as \""business as usual\"" and sometimes even fiefdoms.  We need to hit the reset button every few years, just like we do so in the California Assembly and Senate, along with most city council positions nationwide.

We need new talent from the industry, regular Americans with real world experience and that is more important than experience in government or politics. We need energetic leaders who can solve the big problems of American society today.

Term limits provide accountability, alleviate any corruption issues by ensuring political turnover, and deliver new leadership and new energy.

				<p class=""survey-question"">Who are you? Tell us about yourself in 300 words or less.</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I am a career public servant.  I have spent my adult life either working in the healthcare field, defending our country while serving in the United States Army, or teaching high school science throughout various schools in Indiana.  I was born in Fort Wayne, the heart of Indiana's third congressional district, and moved to Wells County as a child with my parents.  After graduating from high school, I attended Indiana University where I earned a degree in Biology as well as a degree in Political Science and Economics.  While attending Indiana University, September 11th happened.  When this occurred, I felt a responsibility to join the military and defend my country, which is exactly what I did upon graduation from Indiana University.  I therefore enlisted as an infantrymen and went to basic training at Fort Benning, Georgia...the home of the INFANTRY!  

Upon graduating from basic training and advanced individual training, I was assigned to Fort Drum, New York, home of the 10th Mountain Light Infantry Division.  While stationed at Fort Drum, I deployed twice to Afghanistan for a total of 28 months, engaging in multiple encounters with insurgents.  After being honorably discharged, I attended graduate school to earn a Master's in Education and my teaching license.  

For the past eight years, I have been teaching high school science, with the last five at Norwell High School in Wells County.

If elected, I will be the voice of the working families in Northeast Indiana.</p>

5. sensible gun laws</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Who do you look up to? Whose example would you like to follow, and why?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I look up to the late Senator John McCain.  Although Senator McCain had an \""R\"" behind his name, he always voted with his conscience.  I too will vote with my conscience regardless of \""party line\"" votes.  </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What characteristics or principles are most important for an elected official?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">The most important aspect of being an elected official is putting the needs of your constituents ahead of your own.  We need to listen to what our constituents are telling us they need from our government and do our best to meet those needs.   </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What qualities do you possess that you believe would make you a successful officeholder?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Being an officeholder is about being a leader.  Throughout my career in the military as well as in teaching, leading means putting the needs of others above your own.  I will bring this mentality to my position every single day that I am in office.</p>

					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Do you believe that it's beneficial for representatives to have previous experience in government or politics?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">What is most beneficial for a representative to possess if he/she is going to try and govern is a willing to be a public servant.  Without the willingness to put others first, any previous experience is null and void.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What do you perceive to be the United States’ greatest challenges as a nation over the next decade?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Our nation's greatest challenge over the next decade does come from outside sources or from a potential global catastrophe.  Rather, our greatest challenge is re-learning how to work together for the common good.  Nearly every bill that comes to vote is split exactly down party lines.  This is not how our representatives should vote, nor is it always been this way.  If we truly want to be a world leader, it starts with being able to stand up to outside pressures and learning how to work with others in our own government.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">If you are not a current representative, are there certain committees that you would want to be a part of?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">As a former veteran, I would be honored to serve on the Armed Forces committee as well as the Veteran's Affairs committee.  In addition, since I am a science teacher, I would also be interested in being selected for the science, space, and technology committee.  In all three committees, I feel as though I can bring valuable real-world experiences to the other committee members as well be able to have meaningful conversations with those on the committees with more experience than myself. 

Regardless of which committees I am able to serve upon, I will do my best to work with both parties for the betterment of our country.</p>

			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What is your favorite book? Why?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">My favorite book is \""The Power of Now\"" by Ekhart Tolle. This book has helped me through some tough challenges by stressing the importance of living in the present moment.  There were periods in my life that I needed to follow that path in order to move forward. I'm humble about my success and am committed to helping those less fortunate who only need someone to care for them and let them know that they are valued and have as much right to success as anyone.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What is something that has been a struggle in your life?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I had a tough upbringing. As is true for many families today, we struggled. My home life was fraught with chronic and extreme domestic violence, untreated mental illness, and acute substance abuse. We need to stop the stigma and have a bold, honest discussion about trauma in the home so that children living with violence and substance abuse know they are not alone. It's also about social justice. If we're going to end financial inequality, we have to close the education gap. Before we can do that, we need to understand that children from households like mine can't conjugate verbs or learn algebra if they're thinking about what's waiting for them at home. 

Like many children, I had a natural sense that what was happening in my world was not right. Somehow I found a way to right my internal compass and find a way out of the cycle. Later, after my niece Renee was born into the same environment, I reached back and pulled her out as well. She is a now a Princeton grad, recently married, and traveling the world as she works. Proof that the success of one can spur on the success of others!

I believe, by speaking boldly and openly, we can, together, pull back the curtain of secrecy and take away the inherent shame that surrounds \""family problems.\"" As your Congresswoman, I will focus on solving the basic issues that hold our children and families back, especially access to mental health services and drug/alcohol treatment, so that lost opportunities can become stories of success and happiness.</p>

				<p class=""survey-response"">Amy has proven to be the consummate volunteer for causes ranging from local little league teams to advocating for victims of domestic and sexual abuse. In 2014, Amy was elected to the Keizer City Council by an overwhelming 2-to-1 margin.  During her tenure on the city council she was a champion of small business growth and community improvement projects.  Her efforts led directly to the addition of over 1,000 jobs to the Keizer area, including the addition of In-n-Out Burger and Waremart.||As an unpaid city counselor, she also continued to build her small business and is the only Republican candidate in this race who has signed the front side of a check and knows what it's like to meet a payroll.</p>

				<p class=""survey-response"">OR-5 is one of the more conservative districts in Oregon, but you wouldn't know that if you look at our current representation, which takes money from BIG PHARMA and numerous other special interests.
While he claims to support farmers and timber workers, he left his post on the Agriculture Committee and turned his back on Oregon farmers and timber workers. He claims to be bipartisan, but routinely votes against the interests of our families --- until election season comes around.

Amy believes OR-5 can do better. In fact, she believes we MUST do better for our families and our children's future. We can lead the charge for reducing the cost of healthcare while protecting those with preexisting conditions, reducing the regulations on our farmers and timber workers, and completing much needed Federal infrastructure improvements-to include border security.

If any part of Oregon can elect a representative to lead on these and other pressing issues, its OR-5.</p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">Who are you? Tell us about yourself in 300 words or less.</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I was born at The Ohio State University Hospital. For the first nine months of my life, I lived in a foster home before being adopted and raised on the east side of Columbus by a Columbus Public Schools teacher. My mother, an immigrant from Trinidad, supported me and my brother while facing constant financial stress throughout our childhood. But, I got lucky.

I received financial aid to attend Columbus Academy. And that's where this began. I developed an intense commitment to fighting inequality after seeing how opportunities open up, no matter your upbringing, once you're equipped with resources. I later received financial aid with help from the Ron Brown Scholar Program to attend Tufts (BA), Princeton (MA) and Stanford (JD). I then spent three years at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) protecting consumers against predatory lenders and most recently at the Local Initiatives Support Corporation (LISC) which invests in communities that have been systematically under-resourced. I care about nothing more than ending economic segregation-which I believe is systemic. I'm convinced we need a new generation of bold leadership in Congress to ensure that my story is every child's story regardless of the circumstances of one's birth. 

I'm running to represent working people of Ohio's Third Congressional District because 36 years ago, Central Ohio gave me-a newborn with an uncertain future-a chance to succeed.</p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">Please list below 3 key messages of your campaign. What are the main points you want voters to remember about your goals for your time in office?</p>
				<ul class=""key-messages"">
					<li><p> Columbus is the second-most economically segregated metropolitan area in the country and one of the least economically mobile cities in the nation. If you grow up poor here, chances are you stay poor. This is not only true in the Third District, but increasingly, across the entire United States. I will push for bold policies to improve people's financial situations, including: Universal Child Care and Early Learning, Jobs Guarantee, Tuition-Free Public College, Universal Income; Federal Minimum Living Wage; and Medicare for All.</p></li>
					<li><p>Columbus is in Ohio Valley's ""Asthma Belt."" The combination of poverty, pollen, and air quality affects us at a disproportionately higher rate, compared to other cities in the U.S. Asthma is also one of the leading causes of school absenteeism and Columbus ranks as one of the top metropolitan areas in which children miss school due to asthma attacks. Pollution and climate change are keeping our children out of school more than 5,000 days each and every academic year. I will push for bold policies to improve our environment, including but not limited to supporting the Green New Deal.</p></li>
					<li>The unemployment rate in Franklin County is near historic lows, but the number of people who are homeless continues to grow. Between 2012 and 2017, home prices in Central Ohio have risen by an average of nearly six percent annually, while household income has only increased by just over one percent annually during this same period. Gentrification, nearly stagnant wages, and a shortage of affordable housing is forcing far too many people in Columbus to become housing unstable. As a member of Congress I will push for National Rent Stabilization Policies and Increased Affordable Housing Supply.</li>

							<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What areas of public policy are you personally passionate about?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I am campaigning to ensure the economy works for everyone in this country, not just a few. Every single person has value and deserves a chance to live a stable life. My platform seeks to create that stability by ensuring people have access to healthcare, living wage jobs, quality housing, and a clean environment. We also need to redress the racial injustices of the past through systemic reparations.  
 
We must rebalance power away from millionaires and billionaires to working families. Currently, a small group of people and entities (such as those leading the financial services, fossil fuel, and healthcare-related sectors) have managed not only to accumulate the majority of the country's wealth, but also maintain control of our political sector by paying politicians. I am working to ensure we have a political system comprised of representatives who are putting people first by eschewing corporate PAC and lobbyist money.  We also need the wealthy to pay higher taxes and eliminate their ability to shield their income and wealth from taxation. Further, we must shift the dialogue of this country away from hate and fear and towards understanding and inclusion. </p>

Term limits are supported by most of America. They are opposed primarily by incumbent politicians and the special interest groups which depend on them. Term limits would get rid of many of America's most serious political problems by counterbalancing incumbent advantages, ensuring congressional turnover, securing independent congressional judgment, and reducing election related benefits.

				<p class=""survey-response"">SOUTHINGTON - Back in October, FOX 61 told the story of Billy Perry, 14, of Southington who got his ""Make America Great Again"" hat stolen at the Apple Harvest Festival.

Perry believed it was the message on the hat the thieves did not like.


""I definitely got a lot of dirty looks,"" said Perry.

Months later, the hat ended up slightly damaged at the Lost and Found at the Southington Police Department. However, he received an unexpected surprise Saturday night at Renaldo's on Queen Street.

A man named Robert Hyde gave Perry a brand new hat with President Trump's autograph on it.

""This is pretty cool. Not a lot of people have it, so I guess I'm special now,"" added Perry.

Hyde said he met the President during the campaign and after hearing Perry's story on FOX 61, he asked a staffer of Trump International if the President can sign the hat.


""I mean, it's horrible. Who does that? Take somebody else's property and calls him a racist and judges a kid,"" said Hyde of Avon.

When FOX 61 asked Perry how he became a fan of Trump, he said his courageness to speak out on sensitive issues inspired him.

""Just his ability to say what he wants and what he can do and honestly, the main reason I like him is because he was a lot better than the other candidates,"" added Perry.

In addition, Perry was also given a gift certificate to Renaldo's and while he wishes to become a pilot as a possible future career, he said he is not going to rule out being a politician.</p>

				<p class=""survey-response"">I am a retired Colonel in the US Air Force with 28 years of military service, proven leadership experience, and a legacy of service. I was one of the first women to fly and instruct in fighter-type aircraft, command an operational flying squadron, lead in multiple combat zones, and rise to the rank of Colonel. Following retirement from the United States Air Force, I volunteered with the Texas State Guard as Director of Information Technology at state guard Headquarters from 2010 to 2014. Then, I served as President and CEO of Grace After Fire from 2010 to 2015. The nonprofit organization based in Fort Worth helped over 5,500 female veterans and their families find employment, access mental and physical health providers, and conduct peer to peer network training focused of emotional, spiritual, and physical well-being. I was elected to two terms on a local school board and have achieved an MBA from Webster University and 2 masters degrees from our war colleges.

					<li>When I see a problem, I fix it. That's why I battled the Air Force to open flight school to women, modernized the military's response to sexual assault, and advocated for women veterans struggling to re-enter civilian life. That's also why I want to continue my service to this nation as a member of Congress. </li>
					<li>Having served in uniform, commanded troops in combat zones, been elected on a local school board, managed a multi-billion dollar budget at the Pentagon, and served as CEO for non-profit, I believe I have the depth of experience to be an effective leader for my constituents in Congress. </li>
					<li>I am a proven leader with a legacy of service. Throughout my career, I blazed trails and took the doors off the hinges for women and others to rise up behind me in spaces where they were traditionally shut out.</li>

				<p class=""survey-question"">What areas of public policy are you personally passionate about?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">-	My first priority would be to make healthcare available and affordable to everyone. In the richest country in the world, we can, and must, do better. There are common-sense steps we can take immediately to lower costs for working families like lowering the Medicare eligibility age and allowing Medicare to negotiate directly with drug companies to lower costs of prescription drugs. 
-	My next priority would be to take immediate action on climate change. I'm a farmer. I know first hand how climate change is affecting nearly all aspects of our lives. It is the most immediate threat facing our nation right now. Among other efforts, we must promote job-creating renewable energy, uphold emissions standards, and end corporate welfare for polluters. 
-	Lastly, we MUST take steps to reduce gun violence in this country. As a veteran who served in combat zones and a gun owner, I support the 2nd Amendment. Simultaneously, as someone who has a grandson who will one day attend public schools, I find it unacceptable that weapons that could be used in a combat zone could find their way into his classroom. Weapons of war don't belong on our streets. </p>

					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What areas of public policy are you personally passionate about?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Immigration - 
Our beautiful Constitution and Bill of Rights have been the envy of the world for centuries.  Citizens of the world have longed to come to our great nation and enjoy these freedoms and liberties that many countries do not have.  However, when managing a country the size of America, there must be rules and regulations regarding the flow of foreign nationals into our nation.

I am a proponent of “Legal Immigration” to America. Angela believes that those coming to our nation need to be properly documented, have the desire to assimilate into our society, and want to become American citizens.

I also believe that if someone comes into our nation illegally, that person should be prosecuted by our legal system, and dealt with. We should not reward those who come to our nation illegally, take advantage of our generosity, then live outside the law.

I believe in taking the following actions to solve the Immigration issue:

- Building the wall and ending chain migration.
- Ending the “Catch and Release” policy by making expedited removal of illegal aliens mandatory.
- Ending the sanctuary city trend by holding back federal funding and holding elected officials who violate our federal immigration laws legally accountable.
- Placing stiffer penalties on businesses that knowingly hire illegal immigrants.
- Prohibiting illegal aliens from receiving taxpayer-funded welfare benefits.
- Withholding certain federal funds to states that allow illegal immigrants to get drivers’ licenses.</p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">Please list below 3 key messages of your campaign. What are the main points you want voters to remember about your goals for your time in office?</p>
				<ul class=""key-messages"">
					<li><p><span style=""color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial; font-size: 14.6667px; white-space: pre-wrap;"">I will prioritize efforts to restore civil liberties and protect individual rights.</span></p></li>

					<li><p><span style=""color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial; font-size: 14.6667px; white-space: pre-wrap;"">I will work to address social entitlement and welfare reform.</span></p></li>
				</ul>
			</div>
							<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What areas of public policy are you personally passionate about?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I really enjoy the idea of a solvent Government.

Deficit spending is out of hand and needs to be addressed. Deficit spending allows for too much outside interference into how the US Government operates.

Yes, our economy is in a good place. Unemployment is the lowest it has been and the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is up. This is not due to politicians and programs they create. This is due to private industry.

Don't let the politicians take credit for work that the private sector has done. Small businesses and industry supply jobs and products.

We should be judging the performance of our Government and/or elected officials on how much deficit spending is happening and how much the National Debt is increased or decreased.

The two old parties have not done enough to mitigate expenses. It is imperative that we elect officials that refuse to ignore the tasks to stop overspending and pay down the national debt.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Who do you look up to? Whose example would you like to follow, and why?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I look up to my older brother, Joshua Lape.

He has an unshakable faith that I don't have the ability to possess and I admire him for that. Like me, he is a good family man. He treats other people with respect no matter how their views differ.

Over the years we have had many philosophical and ethical discussions. Although we may not always agree, we appreciate one another for having a position and standing by it.

Josh is the reason I looked further into the Libertarian party and found it suited my views better than any other.

I would not be running for office if it weren't for my relationship with my brother. And I acknowledge and thank him for it.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Is there a book, essay, film, or something else you would recommend to someone who wants to understand your political philosophy?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I recommend Hatchet and Shiloh.

Hatchet is about a 13 year old boy that has to survive in the wilderness.

Shiloh is about a boy that shows compassion to a local dog.

Excellent reading for third through fifth graders.

Politically, I recommend reading the platform to the Libertarian Party. This is what really allowed me to think about how issues would be handled in a free society.

I hear Mr. Smith Goes to Washington is good and plan to watch it later this month.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What characteristics or principles are most important for an elected official?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Ethical and honest, protecting freedom above all.

Rights are not gifts from the Government. That is why they are called rights.

Someone that doesn't take credit for another person's work. Someone that gives credit where credit is due.

Someone that lifts up their district and expects them to act with decency and compassion toward one another.

A person that values community, family, and friendship.

Someone willing to make tough decisions to secure freedom.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What qualities do you possess that you believe would make you a successful officeholder?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I'm honest and straightforward.

I hold people accountable for their actions. Integrity is paramount.

I'm forward thinking.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What do you believe are the core responsibilities for someone elected to this office?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">To propose and enact bill's that benefit every citizen in the Representative's district, State, and across the country. 

Note: this doesn't mean we have to spend money for it to benefit everyone.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What legacy would you like to leave?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I would like to usher in an era where the citizens of the United States can say they own their Government. 

I would like to secure the sovereignty of the Government so outside entities can no longer affect its governance.

The Federal Reserve, a private bank, has controlled the U.S. Treasury for too long. We must free the U.S. dollar by going back to a gold or silver standard.

I want to trust in our elected officials again.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What is the first historical event that happened in your lifetime that you remember? How old were you at the time?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I can remember my mom having us make signs for the troops of Operation Desert Storm using puffy paint and old bed sheets.

I also remember seeing news coverage of the Berlin Wall coming down.

I am a child of the 80's, raised through the 90's, and started my own family in the 2000's.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What was your very first job? How long did you have it?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">When I was 15, my Step-Father ran a County nursing home and gave me a job washing dishes in the kitchen.

I was quickly also given the responsibility of meal prep and ensuring residents dietary needs were met.

This summer job was a great experience for getting a full-time High School job at the local McDonald's franchise.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">If you could be any fictional character, who would you want to be?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">V from V for Vendetta?
No wait... Superman.
Clark Kent. Now he was a real gent.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What was the last song that got stuck in your head?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Empty Walls - Serj Tankian (Lead Singer for System of a Down)</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What is something that has been a struggle in your life?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I struggle from time to time with my perception of the world and my contribution to it.

When I was living in a trailer in the middle of a junkyard, I didn't feel like I was struggling any worse than I am now.

Living a simple life, taking care of myself, my family, and making sure my family and friends are ok is all I need. It doesn't feel like much of a struggle when those around you are happy.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What qualities does the U.S. House of Representatives possess that makes it unique as an institution?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">U.S. Congress holds the power of the purse. They control three types of spending for our Government: mandatory, discretionary, and Net interest.

Mandatory spending is required by various acts and laws in place. This includes entitlement programs like Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid.

Discretionary spending is spending that is sent to appropriations committees to be divided among various agencies and programs throughout the Government.

Net interest refers to the amount paid on the interest of the National Debt. This is the amount that should take up a third to half of the annual budget.

Without paying more on Net Interest, the almost $23 Trillion National debt will never get paid down. It will continue to compound interest and our grand children's children will be paying for it.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Do you believe that it's beneficial for representatives to have previous experience in government or politics?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">No. I would prefer them not to.

We need to stop sending career politicians to Washington, D.C.

We need to send fewer lawyers and more technicians, engineers, teachers, nurses, and doctors. The more diverse occupations in politics, the broader experiences available to draw solutions from.

I've worked fast food, retail sales, health care, and manufacturing and have learned that the better solutions come from people from different backgrounds.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What do you perceive to be the United States’ greatest challenges as a nation over the next decade?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Paying off the National Debt and having a solvant Government, free from debt, free from outside interference and influence.

The Federal Reserve has the largest Gold Repository in the world and has allowed our Government to take out high interest loans that allow for immense deficit spending.

Our Government has become so reliant on deficit spending, it is going to take politicians that not only recognize this as a problem but also work toward a plan to get us away from it.

Once deficit spending is outlawed and all debt is paid back, the Government can begin structuring a monetary system no longer based on credit. America will no longer live beyond its means.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">If you are not a current representative, are there certain committees that you would want to be a part of?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Absolutely.
Any ethics committee would be fantastic.
Also appropriations committee.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Do you believe that two years is the right term length for representatives?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Yes and no.

2 years doesn't give much time to introduce a bill and see it through. This is why reelection is important.

But it does give voters a shorter time to vote someone out they may no longer agree with.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What are your thoughts on term limits?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I do believe in consecutive term limits.

For Congress, no more than six conservative terms (12 years)
For Senate, no more than two consecutive terms (12 years)

The President of the United States is limited to two consecutive 4 year terms (8 years)

Other politicians should also be held to this standard.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">If you are not currently a member of your party’s leadership in the U.S. House of Representatives, would you be interested in joining the leadership? If so, in what role?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Absolutely. I would love the chance to introduce future Libertarian House Members into the way we navigate house matters.

I wouldn't mind being the minority house leader.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Is there a particular representative, past or present, whom you want to model yourself after?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Not really. I am my own person. I've seen too many unethical people in politics.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Both sitting representatives and candidates for office hear many personal stories from the residents of their district. Is there a story that you’ve heard that you found particularly touching, memorable, or impactful?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">One of my son's best friends relies on Medicaid for help with life saving heart medication.

Without Medicaid, his mother would not be able to afford the medication.

She feels any Medicaid reform would be a death sentence for her son. I completely hear her and understand her concerns.

Personally, I feel Medicaid needs to be reformed or replaced. This obviously doesn't mean that I want her to struggle and not be able to take care of her son. What it means is that I will work hard to find a fair and appropriate solution to minimize Government spending while helping patients get the affordable medications they need.</p>

			</div>
							<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What areas of public policy are you personally passionate about?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">The heart of our message is the concept of government of the people, by the people, and for the people. This is the principle on which our country was founded, and what we have since struggled to achieve. In the greatest country on earth, so much more is possible. We can achieve a just, equitable, and moral nation but only by achieving this principle. Power in our country is held by a ruling class that makes decisions from which they profit, but from the consequences of which they are far removed. Power remains in the hands of a ruling class because we ask them to change the way they govern. The time to ask for change is long past. We must now take power, and make the change that we seek. This campaign is about empowering every-day people to take a lever of power in their community, and use that lever of power to impact the decisions that our government makes nationally. To do this we will celebrate the people of our district as they strive each day toward achieving their shared American Dream. We will lift our heads collectively toward what is possible. We will engage and organize our community to achieve true self-determination, bowing toward no institutional power, and settling for no status quo.</p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">Who are you? Tell us about yourself in 300 words or less.</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I grew up in the NYC family shelter system and faced many of the challenges my Bronx neighbors experienced - housing scarcity, domestic violence, food insecurity.

I was able to obtain a degree from Columbia University's Barnard College. After college, I worked at Congressmember José E. Serrano's Bronx district office where I assisted with constituent housing in her role as a Congressional Aide.

I enrolled at NYU and graduated with a Masters in Urban Planning with a focus on Housing and Community Development. Samelys interned at the Local Initiatives Support Corporation (LISC) where she gained experience in providing affordable housing for New Yorkers.

My former colleagues and I co-founded Velo City, a youth cycling initiative that recruited youth from the South Bronx and Brownsville to diversify the professions of the built environment to empower youth to fight for the dignity and needs of their communities on their own terms. 

I am currently an activist in the Housing Justice for All statewide coalition which was instrumental in securing quite possibly the most historic pro-tenant rent reforms New York State has ever seen.

I am also an active member and co-founder of Bronx Progressives, a local chapter of the New York Progressive Action Network and Our Revolution. Through Bronx Progressives, Samelys has played a role in helping to build an independent, community led grassroots political movement in the Bronx.</p>

				<ul class=""key-messages"">
					<li>Housing is a human right!</li>

			</div>
							<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What areas of public policy are you personally passionate about?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Housing policy is personal to me because I grew up  in the shelter system. Because of my experiences, I decided to devote my professional life to the affordable housing field, where I helped to build homes in underserved communities throughout NYC, include my home borough of the Bronx. As a member of Congress, I plan on fighting for: secure housing as a universal human right, instituting universal rent control, fully re-investment in public housing, building 12 million units of social housing to end homelessness in America especially as children, seniors, and veterans are concerned, de-commodification of housing to put an end to real estate and land speculation, establishing a People's Housing Commission, National Tenant Bill of Rights, reparations to reverse the impact of generations of redlining.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Who do you look up to? Whose example would you like to follow, and why?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">First of all, I have great respect for the outgoing Congressman Jose Serrano.  He was an avid supporter of environmental issues in New York, such as constructing greenways, acquiring parklands, and cleaning up the Bronx River, which runs through the South Bronx. He was someone who really cared about the people in his district and worked as hard as could to improve their lives; I want to build on that legacy in the South Bronx and fight for the people  like he did.

I am also a big fan of Bernie Sanders. He is someone who has been fighting for universal healthcare, labor rights, LGBTQ rights,  women's rights, and the rights of communities of color for over 40 years.  I plan to spend my life fighting for working families in this country, just as he did.

I also have great respect for people like representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and am proud to be endorsed by her Courage to Change PAC. She has been an incredible fighter in Congress for working people in this country. I  greatly respect the work that she has done in regards issues such as the Green New Deal, to combat climate change and create millions of new jobs in the process.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What characteristics or principles are most important for an elected official?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I believe the most important characteristic an elected official should have is compassion. My home in the South Bronx, there are countless people who experience poverty, malnutrition, homelessness, and so many other struggles in their day to day lives. I believe that elected officials need to have love and compassion for the people they represent, so that they are willing to fight for them when they get into congress. Without that compassion, then those elected officials will only focus on enriching themselves and consolidating their own power, instead of helping the people they represent.</p>

				<p class=""survey-response"">I am someone who is from the community and has gone through many of the same struggles my neighbors faced (malnutrition, homelessness, underfunded schools, etc.). I understand first hand many of the same problems that people in the community go through on a daily basis and I will take that understanding with me to Congress. My experiences will allow me to advocate for the people in my congressional district and fight for the policies to improve their lives.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What do you believe are the core responsibilities for someone elected to this office?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">An elected official needs to be accountable to the people in the community and have their best interests in mind. Too many politicians are bought and paid for by the real estate industry, the pharmaceutical industry, and the military industrial complex. The main goal of an elected official is to advocate for the needs of the people in their community and do whatever they can to improve the lives of working people in this country.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What is something that has been a struggle in your life?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">When I was a child, I spent time in the homeless shelter in the South Bronx because my mother was trying to flee domestic abuse. I never wanted anyone else to be in the same position that I was in, so I decided to devote my life to fighting for affordable housing here in NYC.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What qualities does the U.S. House of Representatives possess that makes it unique as an institution?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">The US House of Representatives, unlike the Senate is representative of the entire nation. The congressional districts are drawn in such a way that each member of the House of Representatives speaks for roughly the same amount of people in Congress. Conversely, each state has 2 senators, regardless of the population of their state. Because the House more accurately represents the American people than the Senate, it is inherently a more democratic institution.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Do you believe that it's beneficial for representatives to have previous experience in government or politics?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">It's not as important to have experience in government in politics, as it is to have a desire to help the members of your community. For far too long, those who have represented the Bronx have failed to look out for our collective good or protect the most vulnerable. We have suffered neglect, abuse, and exploitation. We urgently need to organize now to reclaim the power that belongs to us! Many politicians that have represented the Bronx use it as a line on their resume, but do not deliver results for the people actually living here.  The Bronx deserves someone better than a career politician vying for higher office, they deserve someone who actually cares about the people in the community.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What do you perceive to be the United States’ greatest challenges as a nation over the next decade?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">The greatest existential threat we face is climate change. We have until 2030  to severely reduce the carbon emissions in the United States if we want to stave off the worst effects that climate change will have on our planet. These effects include rising sea levels and increased severity of extreme weather events like hurricanes. In order to do that, our government needs to invest heavily in renewable energy sources like solar and wind, and fight against the greed of the fossil fuel industry that will fight against us tooth and nail.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">If you are not a current representative, are there certain committees that you would want to be a part of?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Fighting for housing as a human right will be my top priority while serving as a member of Congress. Serving on the United States House Committee on Financial Services and Housing, Community Development and Insurance Subcommittee  would allow me to oversee the  Department of Housing and Urban Development  and ensure that we are adequately allocating resourcing to public housing in this country.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Do you believe that two years is the right term length for representatives?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Two years is just the right length of time to be a representative. It allows you enough time to advocate for your constituents and be held accountable very quickly, through the ballot box, if you do not fight for legislation that betters their lives.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What are your thoughts on term limits?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I am supportive of term limits. I do not believe that people should be holding the same office of power for decades. After a certain point, most people will become out of touch with their community they represent and only focus on holding onto their seat and the power of the institution they represent.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Is there a particular representative, past or present, whom you want to model yourself after?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I highly respect the work that AOC has done while she is in office. She has done an incredible job at shifting the political discourse to the left, especially in regards to the Green New Deal.  During my first term in office, I would try to follow that model and push the overton window further to the left in regards; to make the argument to the American people that housing should be treat as a human right and we need to invest in affordable housing.

I also greatly respect the work that Jose Serrano, the retiring incumbent of NY-15, has done for the people in his community. I worked at Congressmember José E. Serrano's Bronx district office where I assisted with constituent housing in her role as a Congressional Aide. I saw how hard he worked to ensure that the people in district could live good, decent lives and I want to build on his legacy and fight for the  people of the South Bronx.</p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">Who are you? Tell us about yourself in 300 words or less.</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Duane Whitmer is an accountant and small business owner from Franklinville, NY who currently resides in Hamburg, NY.   A SUNY Fredonia graduate in 2009 with a bachelors of science in accounting, Duane spent  7 years in public and private accounting before opening his own firm in 2014.   Duane enjoys playing soccer and volleyball after working.   Duane is the current chairman of the Erie County (NY) Libertarian Committee, starting in August 2019.   As an accountant, Duane works specifically with small businesses and not for profits. He has seen the devastating effects the tax code has had on the growth of small businesses. He has also seen corporations get tax payer subsidies while smaller locally owned businesses get hung out to dry.  </p>
			</div>
						    <div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Please list below 3 key messages of your campaign. What are the main points you want voters to remember about your goals for your time in office?</p>
				<ul class=""key-messages"">
					<li>End the war </li>
					<li>Repeal tax on social security income </li>
					<li>Revitalize the Small Business Administration </li>
				</ul>
			</div>
							<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What areas of public policy are you personally passionate about?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">As an accountant, Duane specializes in working with the tax code. He would love to see it restructured to help the middle class and small business owners more. He also would like to see the small business association revamped to where it actually loans to small businesses to allow them to grow.   He would like to see the wars in the Middle East come to an end, and no more wars started in other countries.   He would like to see government stop sending money to foreign countries and instead be spent on rebuilding the infrastructure of the USA.   </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Who do you look up to? Whose example would you like to follow, and why?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">As a libertarian I look up to Larry Sharpe, he was able to get us ballot access in New York State which allowed candidates like me to run and have an easier time.   In non politics I look up to both my father and step father. Two of the hardest working men I have ever met. I was lucky to have them raise me. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What characteristics or principles are most important for an elected official?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Dignity, honesty, and the ability to be humble. As an accountant, I don't know everything. You have to be able to adapt as you listen to specific professionals.  </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What legacy would you like to leave?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I would like to show the country a third party candidate can win, and make an impact. I would like to set a precedent for other people interested in getting involved. If I win, I can give a blue print to others to show how it is possible for a third party to win elections on a federal level. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What is the first historical event that happened in your lifetime that you remember? How old were you at the time?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">2000 election Bush v Gore. The 'hanging chad' election. I was 13.  </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What was your very first job? How long did you have it?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">SUNY Fredonia library. All four years of college. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What was the last song that got stuck in your head?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Lynyrd Skynyrd - Gimme Back My Bullets. Favorite song of all time - describes my life so well. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Do you believe that it's beneficial for representatives to have previous experience in government or politics?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Absolutely not - if you are to represent your district, most of your constituents don't have any political experience either. A true representative would have experience working with people in the district.   Also, real life experience is important in its own way. Dealing with a bureaucracy that is know to be inefficient and corrupt doesn't make a great representative. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What do you perceive to be the United States’ greatest challenges as a nation over the next decade?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Division and lack of unity. As people become more divided, they are easy to manipulate and convince to hate the other side. If the US population came together and realized they are being fooled by politicians, we can start to remove the lame duck politicians and vote in people who truly care and want to see positive change. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Do you believe that two years is the right term length for representatives?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">No, this means that they have to constantly fundraise for re election as soon as their election is over. I would say 4 or even 6 year terms would be more acceptable. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What are your thoughts on term limits?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Yes, spending 40 years in Congress while not passing many bills doesn't make a good representative. If you had a real job, and didn't do much you'd be fired, but since most elections are a popularity contest based on who has the most money. It's harder to fire these politicians. </p>

				<p class=""survey-response"">I believe there are two:

Is this something the federal government is permitted to do per the constitution?

If so, is it a necessary and proper use of taxpayer money?</p>

				<p class=""survey-response"">When I was in junior high school, as part of my US Civics class, I studied the 1980 Presidential election between Ronald Reagan and Jimmy Carter. This experience ignited a lifelong love of US History and government for me.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What is your favorite book? Why?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">These is My Words (The Diary of Sarah Agnes Prine 1881-1901) by Nancy Turner

I loved this story of a strong, resilient woman in the Arizona territory. Despite much adversity, she never lost her ability to love, learn and grow. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What qualities does the U.S. House of Representatives possess that makes it unique as an institution?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">It's the federal office closest to the People. It's imperative that anyone who serves in this position is accessible and responsive to those they represent. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Do you believe that it's beneficial for representatives to have previous experience in government or politics?</p>

			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What do you perceive to be the United States’ greatest challenges as a nation over the next decade?</p>

Our policies reflect our communities' values and hopes as we combat negative legislation that threatens our well-being. My aim is to empower the citizens of the district to connect with their federal representatives in efforts to produce sustainable changes that reflect the diversity of our communities where race, color, gender, sexual orientation, disability, identity, age, veteran status, national origin, or religious denomination are no longer barriers to participation.

				<p class=""survey-question"">Who are you? Tell us about yourself in 300 words or less.</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I'm a 29 year old Utah native and I live in South Jordan, Utah, with my partner of 6 years. I am a Utah native, born and raised in St. George, and I have lived across the State including in Orem, Logan, Salt Lake City, and now South Jordan. I studied communications and political science at Utah State and Utah Valley University and I have been passionate about politics my entire life. I worked for many years in the healthcare industry, and I saw first-hand how people struggled to afford basic procedures and get insurance coverage.

I believe that this Utah's 4th district is ready for progressive representation and a candidate who will fight for policies that truly benefit everyone. People know that the status quo isn't working for them, and they need a candidate who will give them something to get out and vote for. That is why I support the progressive platform, including policies such as Medicare for All, the Green New Deal, tuition-free education, and more.

This campaign will not accept corporate PAC money or lobbyist money because I believe that money is the number one corrupting influence in Congress. It is why I will fight to get money out of politics and return the power back to the people where it belongs. </p>

					<li>Campaign Finance Reform</li>
					<li>Medicare for All</li>
					<li>Green New Deal</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
							<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What areas of public policy are you personally passionate about?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Having worked in healthcare for many years, my job was to directly deal with insurance companies and figure out coverage. It became increasingly frustrating to see how insurance companies prioritized profit over patient care, and costs were often pushed unfairly onto the patient for services. This led me to become supportive of Medicare for All, which would eliminate private insurance companies and guarantee coverage for every single American through a single payer system. 

I am also passionate about the Green New Deal and creating a framework that will address our usage of fossil fuels. Salt Lake and surrounding areas have notoriously poor air quality, especially in the winter, due to the usage of fossil fuels. I believe that only aggressive policies will provide the solution we need to clear up our air and transition entirely to renewable energy sources.

I also support cancelling student loan debt and ensuring tuition-free public colleges, universities, and trade schools. Education is the #1 investment we can make into our nation's future and wellbeing, and that means guaranteeing everyone the opportunity to attend.

We also have to get big money out of politics and transition to public financing of elections. Corporate and lobbyist influence is the number one corrupting force in Congress and we have got to change that. That is why this campaign will not accept corporate PACs or lobbyist money. We must overturn Citizen's United and return the power to the people.</p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">Who do you look up to? Whose example would you like to follow, and why?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is a person I look up to, an example I look to follow, and the inspiration for this campaign run. AOC proved that it is possible to organize an entirely grassroots campaign and with the help of the people oust a corporate Democrat who wasn't serving his constituents. She has also been a firebrand in Congress, drawing attention to critical inequalities and failures of our political system that have left the working class behind. We need more people like her in Congress who are willing to speak out against the system and fight for policies that will restore confidence in Congress and return the power back to the people. </p>

					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What do you perceive to be the United States’ greatest challenges as a nation over the next decade?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">One of the greatest challenges that the U.S. will face over the next decade is the increasing influence of money and lobbyists in politics. As long as we continue to allow big money to influence our politicians, they will continue to work on their behalf, and not on behalf of their constituents. If we are to be successful in passing overwhelmingly popular policies such as Medicare for All, the Green New Deal, and tuition-free public education, then we have to start by eliminating the barrier of lobbyists and big money. </p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">Who are you? Tell us about yourself in 300 words or less.</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Dani Brzozowski is a community leader and activist from LaSalle, Illinois. She has been a leader in the effort for a better quality of life in Illinois and has worked to develop communities and empower individuals. Dani is an army brat whose family moved all over but found a home in LaSalle. She went to Purdue and then lived in Chicago for almost 10 years before moving back home a few years ago so that she could give back to a community that had given her a great deal.


She is running to represent the Illinois 16th District in Congress to fight for her neighbors and members of her community and wants to be the voice for the countless individuals and families who are not being correctly represented on Capitol Hill right now. </p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">Please list below 3 key messages of your campaign. What are the main points you want voters to remember about your goals for your time in office?</p>
				<ul class=""key-messages"">
					<li>Protect the rights of Unions and working people everywhere.</li>
					<li>Overturn Citizens United and end the influence of big money in politics</li>
					<li>Ensure healthcare as a basic human right with Medicare for All.</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
							<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What areas of public policy are you personally passionate about?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I am passionate about economic, social, environmental, and political justice. Economic justice means that we empower workers by protecting their rights that are constantly under attack. I will always look to empower workers and strengthen their rights in the workplace. I will be a fierce advocate for strengthening our social safety net. The United States of America is the wealthiest nation on earth, but far too much of that wealth is concentrated at the top, meaning that the rich get richer while leaving the vast majority of working Americans behind. Social justice means standing for equality for every single American regardless of race, gender, sexuality, gender identity, religion, etc. It also means fighting for a more fair and equitable criminal justice system and protecting reproductive health rights for women. Environmental justice ties in with the economic justice mentioned before. By supporting clean energy in order to combat the climate crisis (make no mistake, it is a crisis), we have a unique opportunity to create clean energy jobs across the country. Environmental justice also means holding polluters accountable. When it comes to political justice, I am talking about ending the corrupting influence that corporate money has on our politics and also protecting the right to vote that has been under attack since the Supreme Court gutted the Voting Rights Act. </p>

 Altogether, I want to make a difference for Wake County and, like you, am frustrated and disappointed with the Congressional gridlock and lack of bipartisan effort in Washington D.C. Never ending impeachment proceedings rather than doing the work that is needed for the American people on key issues such as improving Healthcare and transportation Infrastructure, reducing growing Crime and illegal Drugs, steps to improve Education, and long overdue Comprehensive Immigration Reform is hindering progress. My campaign platform is completely centered around making a positive change and improvement for Wake County!  I will be a Wake County Republican.  If a law does not improve or show positive change for Wake County, I will not vote affirmatively. I am #WAKESTRONG... ALL FOR WAKE, WAKE FOR AL!</p>

				<p class=""survey-response"">I'm Dana Barrett, a Democrat, a fighter, and a real person who wants to make a difference for the people of Georgia's 11th Congressional District, and for this country.

As a talk radio host for the last 5 years, I realized that sharing my views with listeners who already agree with me, might make us all feel good, but it wasn't going to change the system.

I'm a single working Mom, and I don't accept that women, and especially women of color, are paid less than men.  That has to change.

As a breast cancer survivor, who has despaired over huge medical bills, I don't accept that getting sick, should make you poor, while insurance companies get rich.  Or that we should let our neighbors die because they can't afford their medicine.  That has to change.

I don't accept that one sentence written over 200 years ago is a good enough reason to allow mass shootings to continue unchecked.  I don't believe that the government should have agency over my body, or tell me who I can love or marry.  I don't accept that we are spending trillions of dollars for a gridlocked government. These are just some of the things that need to change.  

I'm running because I believe we have to get in the system to change the system, and I need your help to do it!</p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">Who are you? Tell us about yourself in 300 words or less.</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I grew up in Northwest Iowa on a family farm. At an early age I was feeding livestock, cleaning henhouses, and learning the hard work that goes into farming. For many years I was a member of 4-H, showing pets, exhibiting art, and doing presentations annually at the Iowa State Fair.  In 2012, I graduated with a degree in Information Technology. My internship led me to a job as a Technical Sales Engineer with a company that worked for county and city government.  This job took me all over Iowa and Eastern Nebraska. It allowed me to meet with government officials and constituents from rural and urban areas. I spent a lot of time listening to them. Often, I had to present researched technical ideas at public meetings, as well as speak with the press and constituents. I also learned the hard facts of budgeting for government. In 2014, I was named to the MSPmentor 250 list for my work in county government. Since then, I have worked for government contractors and a non-profit hospital.  In 2017, I moved to Bellevue with my fiancée, two sons, two dogs, and my cat. Immediately, I fell in love with the state of Nebraska. Shortly after moving to town, I helped found the adult transgender support group, Transformative, with my therapist. This group is a space for any transgender and non-binary individuals to feel safe.</p>

Hank is proposing a nation-wide rural broadband project, on the scale of the highway system, that would bring reliable, good internet access to all Americans.

				<p class=""survey-question"">What would be your top three priorities, if elected?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Get the money out of politics
Institute Medicare for All
Combat climate change through renewable investment</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What areas of public policy are you personally passionate about?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I'm passionate about our healthcare system. We spend too much money in this country on our insurance and then must pay even more for using it. We need a better way to ensure everyone gets the care they need. I support Medicare for All because a single payer system is the only way to make sure no one falls through the cracks.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Who do you look up to? Whose example would you like to follow, and why?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I look up to Paul Wellstone for his ability to stay true to his values. He was a progressive voice that did not waiver and did not vote just for what would get him reelected. He was not afraid to criticize the decision to enter war, and we absolutely need more rational voices like his to help get us out of our current situation.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What characteristics or principles are most important for an elected official?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Integrity is key for our elected officials. We need people with the courage to tell the truth even if that means admitting your political allies have lied. We are so mislead in the country because of constant lies from many of our senior public officials. We can disagree, and when we do, we can learn to compromise again. However, if we only lie to each other, we'll never come to rational decisions. I have that integrity. I will state the truth and not conflate opinion with fact.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What qualities do you possess that you believe would make you a successful officeholder?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I'm a veteran. I understand that public office is service, and that's exactly how I will treat that office. I have the courage to never turn my back on my constituents. I will keep having town halls as a representative, and I will keep engaging my community. Holding office is not about making money for our reelection campaigns, it's about serving your community.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What do you believe are the core responsibilities for someone elected to this office?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">The core responsibilities of a representative are constituent services and responsiveness, continuous education of policy, and careful consideration of legislation. Now more than ever, our representatives are forgoing town halls and public appearances for TV ads and private meetings with donors. Lobbyists write bills, and they pay our politicians in legal bribes for their votes. The core responsibilities are being eschewed, but I will not let money become such a central theme in the way I legislate, and I will not abandon any of my constituents whether they voted for me or not.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What legacy would you like to leave?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I would like to leave Congress at the end of a term limit I helped institute. I want our legislators to be unable to collect money from corporations and instead speak to their constituents for donations and their votes personally. I want to bring not just civility back to our legislative branch, but the ability to make good positive decisions that the public agrees with without falling back into partisan games.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What is the first historical event that happened in your lifetime that you remember? How old were you at the time?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I was 11 on September 11th, 2001. I was in school when our teachers heard the news. They wheeled in a TV to play the news for us. Everything just stood still while we watched, every classroom silent. It took more than just that day for everything to sink in. We found out that some people in our school had lost a family member, like one of my teachers that lost a sister. We still feel the impact of that attack today. In many ways, it has defined much of my life. I joined the military and fought the same wars that stemmed from the attack, and I'm running for office now in part to end the those wars.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What was your very first job? How long did you have it?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">My first job was at Subway (eat fresh). I carefully constructed thousands of $5 footlongs and worked up from part time after school worker to management during the 4 years I had with the company before I joined the Air Force.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What do you perceive to be the United States’ greatest challenges as a nation over the next decade?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">The biggest challenge ahead of us is correcting the damage done to our climate. We have to change the way we subsidies fossil fuel industries and start investing heavily into renewable alternatives. The next decade is key to mitigating some of the worst climate change may bring, so it's imminently important our government makes the policy changes that will help the industries in our country that our helping solve this problem.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Do you believe that two years is the right term length for representatives?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Yes. The Representatives are supposed to by extremely conscious of their constituents needs and be as available as possible. Having only two years means their easily replaceable if they aren't responsive to the electorate. Money has distorted elections, however, so we don't necessarily see this working as intended, and it's easy for Representatives to more or less ignore their constituents.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What are your thoughts on term limits?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I agree with term limits for US Congress. As a possibility that is by no means set in stone: 5 terms for House of Representatives and 3 terms for Senate for a grand total of 28 possible years in Congress. That seems more than enough to me, yet we have plenty of Representatives and Senators that have served much longer than that.</p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">Who are you? Tell us about yourself in 300 words or less.</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I am a brother, father, mentor, community organizer, and a public servant. I was born and raised in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. I'm one of seven children and I'm a proud product of public schools. I grew up in a lower middle class household with strong Christian values that have guided me for my entire life. I believe in tolerance, acceptance, and love for all of humanity regardless of race, religion, or sexual orientation.

I'm a proud alumnus of Louisiana State University. Geaux Tigers! I earned my Bachelor of Science degree in Child and Family Studies. I am expecting to graduate with a Master of Public Administration degree with a concentration in Public Policy in May of 2020. I'm an advocate for traditional public schools and I firmly believe in the importance of every child receiving a quality education regardless of their zip code. 

I'm a lover of the arts, particularly the performing arts. I have dedicated my life to being a positive role model for the youth of our city and state.  I fight every day to remove the barriers to success for those who are less fortunate and to ensure that the next generation has an opportunity to achieve the heights of their dreams in our city, state, and country. 

I will always be a voice for freedom, justice, and equality for all people. </p>

					<li>I'm running to be a voice for those who feel unheard by our elected officials in Congress. </li>

			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Who do you look up to? Whose example would you like to follow, and why?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I look up to every person, both living and deceased, who has dedicated their lives to fight for freedom, justice, and equality. I stand on their shoulders and honor them by carrying on their work to advance policies that are fair and representative of this melting pot of cultures and ideas that we call America. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Is there a book, essay, film, or something else you would recommend to someone who wants to understand your political philosophy?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I recommend that anyone who is running for office or holds office read \""Adaptive Leadership\"" by Heifetz, Grashow, &amp; Linksey.

This book certainly provides a great glimpse into my political philosophy and my approach to leadership in this political era. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What characteristics or principles are most important for an elected official?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Honesty, integrity, and humility are most important characteristics of all elected officials. 

They should all embody a willingness to hear from the people and to serve those who have elected them to be their voices in Congress. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What qualities do you possess that you believe would make you a successful officeholder?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">The qualities I posses that would make me a successful office holder are humility, honesty, and integrity. I'm a trustworthy man of my word. I will always be truthful in my dealings with my constituents and I'll always listen and seek common ground even if we fundamentally disagree. I love my community and the people of my state. 

I'll gladly be a one term Senator if my longevity in office means betraying my community or my core values. My ambition has never been more important to me than my integrity.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What do you believe are the core responsibilities for someone elected to this office?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">The core responsibility of anyone serving in office is constituency service. They must recognize that they were elected to work for the people, not the other way around. 

They are responsible for passing legislation that is supposed to be fair and representative of the values of all of their constituency, not just their respective party's agenda. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What legacy would you like to leave?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I would like to show the next generation what is possible in government with a deep core belief and integrity. I want to show my community that there are people who genuinely care about their needs that will listen and work to bring about necessary change. I'd like my legacy to be that I was a man who stuck to my convictions and always did what I thought was right even it went against the grain and was politcally unpopular. 

Nothing this world or the U.S. Senate can offer me is more important than my integrity. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What is your favorite book? Why?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I read ALOT! I don't have a favorite book, but I do have a favorite reading list. 

Adaptive Leadership 
The Meritocracy Trap
The Color of Law
The Death of Expertise
Tears We Cannot Stop
What the Truth Sounds Like 
Seeing Like a State
You're More Powerful Than You Think

These are just a few that are on my repeat reading list..</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">If you could be any fictional character, who would you want to be?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I think I'd like to be King T'Challa also know as The Black Panther </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What was the last song that got stuck in your head?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">\""How deep is your love?\"" - Bee Gees my</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What is something that has been a struggle in your life?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I grew up relatively poor. It has always been a struggle to rise above the life that poverty creates for those who are born into it. I recognize the obstacles because I'm personally faced by them. I know how hard it is to overcome the grips of poverty. 

That's why I've made it my life's mission to get out of poverty and to help others find their way out..</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What do you perceive to be the United States’ greatest challenges as a nation over the next decade?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">The country's greatest challenge will be overcoming the partisanship and tribalism that permeates our political discourse. We will have to find a way to communicate beyond to polarization to find common ground and work towards a fair and equitable future for every person in this country. We must find a way to live in this country together and to implement policies that reach beyond political ideologies and address the longstanding disparities that persist. 

We must do some serious introspection and recognize that despite our nuanced differences, there is a singular thread that connects us all. That thread is our humanity. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What qualities does the U.S. Senate possess that makes it unique as an institution?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">The U.S. Senate seats have longer terms. They hold office for six years. This gives him or her the opportunity to be more measured and meticulous about their policy positions and more deliberate in their implementation.

The U.S. Senate makes extremely important decisions about the governance of our country including U.S. Supreme Court confirmation, federal judgeship appointments, cabinet confirmations, and impeachment. These responsibilities are in addition to the role of passing legislation for the good of the country and providing a separate, but coequal check on the executive branch. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Do you believe that it’s beneficial for senators to have previous experience in government or politics?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I don't believe it hurts to have previous experience in government or politics, but I don't think it's necessary. Congress was not designed to be a monolith. Our democracy flourishes when all voices from all walks of life are represented by their respective elected officials.  

I think it's more important to have compassion for one's constituents and integrity to be honest and fair than it is to have experience. I'd choose a candidate with no experience that shares my values and speaks to the issues that are important to me over a career politician who ignores my needs for political expedience. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What criteria would you apply when deciding whether to confirm presidential appointees?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Presidential appointees must throughly understand the role they are being appointed to. They must display an ability to be an Independent thinker that is not swayed by the expedience or political ebbs and flows of politics. They must be fair and impartial in their role and they must be willing to accept and implement the recommendations of officials on either side of the aisle if it will produce better outcomes. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Do you believe it’s beneficial to build relationships with other senators?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Yes. The entire process of bipartisanship begins with coalition building. It's imperative that every U.S. Senator builds relationships with others, both within their own party, and with those who may be across the aisle. That truly is the only way that we will see the social, economic, and political progress that we need to see. </p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">What would be your top three priorities, if elected?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">My top three priorities are advocating for single payer health care, public financing of elections, challenging the military industrial complex.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What areas of public policy are you personally passionate about?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Congress has abdicated too much of it's authority to the executive branch. This imbalance must be corrected. Congress has not been defending our constitutional rights, the implied right to privacy. Our fourth amendment rights have been repeatedly violated after the attacks on September 11th. Our foreign policy has been a disaster creating mass migration and instability in the world.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Who do you look up to? Whose example would you like to follow, and why?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Bernie Sanders inspired me and gives me hope for our future. I would not likely be running to if he didn't first demonstrate there were so many progressives ready to challenge the status quo. He demonstrated the necessity of competitive primaries.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Is there a book, essay, film, or something else you would recommend to someone who wants to understand your political philosophy?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">A book that describes my political philosophy? I love the novel Jaws, it was the first novel I read at age 11. My aunt bought me the book. Climate change </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What characteristics or principles are most important for an elected official?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Characteristics that are important are politicians who practice what they preach. Leaders act and live their truth. So if you say you support Unions, do you shop union? Is there consistency in their words and actions? Also openness to learn new facts is critical.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What qualities do you possess that you believe would make you a successful officeholder?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Qualities I have that make me right for this office? I am a working class person. Born to a hair dresser and car wash attendant. I truly understand the struggle of working people! I want to fight for the working class, the working poor, the weakest among us with my all my heart, all my soul and all my mind. I can lead a life of service, and not be corrupted by easy money. I will never take money from the military industrial complex, insurance, and financial industry or anything evil. I will stand with and for the people in the 4th district always. I will put people over party. I will put country over party. I will fight corruption.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What do you believe are the core responsibilities for someone elected to this office?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">The core responsibilities of the office is to fiercely represent the people in the district. Defend the constitution. Improve peoples lives! Our republic has been transformed into an oligarchy that isn't representative of the people. I need to be a voice and a force of change!</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What legacy would you like to leave?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I hope to leave a legacy of progressive policy that saves our republic from a ruling class of despicable people that don't give a darn about you!</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What is the first historical event that happened in your lifetime that you remember? How old were you at the time?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">My earliest memory is my mother taking me to Sears as a very young boy, for a photo set. I also recall my first day of preschool at Saint Matthews where I spent most of my early education before high school on the West Side of Saint Paul.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What was your very first job? How long did you have it?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">My first real job was working for Saint Paul parks and recreation as a ski instructor and lifeguard from 2001-2008.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What happened on your most awkward date?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">My most awkward date? I actually have not been on many! My first date was in college with a perfect nerdy guy, I just instantly felt a strong attraction for. I have allergies and I sneezed, it was juicy, it embarrassed me. Sadly, I didn't make the cut. I spent years loosing weight and when I reconnected with him, he was set to get married. I wish him all the joy, that only love can bring.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What is your favorite holiday? Why?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">My favorite holiday was Christmas, but it's not the same now that the extended family does not get together at grandma's house like we used to. So now it's Thanksgiving because I love turkey, mashed potatoes with gravy, and scratch made ravioli at our gatherings. The family attendance is better than Christmas these days.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What is your favorite book? Why?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">My favorite book is Jaws, it's the first novel I read. It got me interested in politics! The politics of the Mayor was a larger aspect in the book. The class struggle with the Chief, his wife, Hooper and everything was perfect! It is a perfect story! I read more Peter Benchley but Jaws is my favorite. Sorry to Stephen King, my favorite author, that my favorite book isn't one of his.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">If you could be any fictional character, who would you want to be?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">If I could be a fictional character? When I picked my Halloween costume, I was Dirty Harry, Chief Brody, a wizard. Being a wizard was my favorite costume. As an adult I want to be the Goblin King from Labyrinth. But who could ever pull that off better than David Bowie?</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What is your favorite thing in your home or apartment? Why?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I love my little town home. I don't have to shovel, I have a garage, and it's all mine. I live a simple life, and it pleases me.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What was the last song that got stuck in your head?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I am a huge Dwight Yoakam fan. I was listening to a mix CD recently I made 16 years ago of his music, music which I paid for, but burned onto a cd. ""Ain't that lonely yet"" and ""She wore red dresses"" have been on mental repeat.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What is something that has been a struggle in your life?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">All my life I struggled with my weight. I dropped 160lbs and have kept it off, hopefully for good this time. I struggled with being gay, I was closeted through high school. I still struggle with accepting myself.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What qualities does the U.S. House of Representatives possess that makes it unique as an institution?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Congress is unique because it's supposed to be the most powerful branch of government. Some people say the three branches are coequal but they are not! The Congress makes the laws, the congress controls the money and decides when we commit to war! At least that is what the constitution intended!</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Do you believe that it's beneficial for representatives to have previous experience in government or politics?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Yes, previous government and political experience is helpful. Also someone can be there too long, loose touch and become less effective as a result.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What do you perceive to be the United States’ greatest challenges as a nation over the next decade?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Over the next decade, climate change is going to be the cause of or escalation factor of multiple crisis. Followed by the fact that the United States isn't the only superpower in the world. How will we function and peacefully coexist with another major superpower? A hint I will give you, is we need to start respecting international laws.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">If you are not a current representative, are there certain committees that you would want to be a part of?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Well of course I want to be on the appropriations committee, followed by energy and commerce, then armed services.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Do you believe that two years is the right term length for representatives?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Yes two years keeps part of the legislative body more attentive to the people.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What are your thoughts on term limits?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I support term limits, especially since parties have an anticompetitive culture it would help keep leadership fresh.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What process do you favor for redistricting?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">We need to end partisan districting.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">If you are not currently a member of your party’s leadership in the U.S. House of Representatives, would you be interested in joining the leadership? If so, in what role?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I want very much to be a party leader and serve to challenge party corruption.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Is there a particular representative, past or present, whom you want to model yourself after?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I want to be like Bernie Sanders who has consistently been on the right side of history.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Both sitting representatives and candidates for office hear many personal stories from the residents of their district. Is there a story that you’ve heard that you found particularly touching, memorable, or impactful?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">So far running for congress I have spoken with hundreds of people. it is overwhelming how many struggles people share. I actually broke down and cried after hearing from someone who lost a daughter who was delayed access to care because her daughter was confused about insurance coverage from being between jobs and in the confusion was discharged instead of treated. Her daughter died as a result.</p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">Who are you? Tell us about yourself in 300 words or less.</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Tom Brier announced his candidacy for U.S. House in March 2019. Despite taking the No Corporate PAC pledge, Brier has garnered significant press for his impressive fundraising reports. 

Brier is a Hershey native. He earned his degree in Philosophy and English from Dickinson College, where he played varsity basketball. After Dickinson, Brier earned his J.D. from Penn State Law, where he was the only student in the country to speak at a cybersecurity conference with the FCC and was chosen by his classmates to speak at graduation. 

After law school, Brier clerked on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit before joining an international law firm in Philadelphia. As an attorney, he worked closely with the SeniorLAW Center and other pro bono organizations to provide legal assistance to low-income families. He also published articles in leading legal publications on issues relating to the Internet of Things, cryptocurrency, and biometric data. 

Brier is also the author of the highly acclaimed book, While Reason Slept, which was described by Kathleen Kennedy Townsend as ""brilliant"" and a ""must read for those who want to use an argument grounded in reason to change the nature of political discourse.""

						    <div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Please list below 3 key messages of your campaign. What are the main points you want voters to remember about your goals for your time in office?</p>
				<ul class=""key-messages"">
					<li>Improving our Healthcare Infrastructure - ""Every American deserves access to quality, affordable healthcare. We need to protect people with pre-existing conditions, lower the cost of prescription drugs, and expand coverage for Medicare and Medicaid.""</li>
					<li>Economy - ""The American economy is defined by radical inequality. Reforming the economy starts with requiring our nation's largest corporations paying a federal income tax. Instead of giving away billions of dollars in tax cuts to corporations, we should invest in Pennsylvania's infrastructure, which will create jobs now and safeguard our future.""</li>
					<li>Climate Change  - ""Climate change is the defining issue of our time. We must achieve a net-zero carbon economy by 2050 if we want to preserve our planet for future generations. In the process, we can create new jobs and reinvigorate our economy.""</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
							<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What areas of public policy are you personally passionate about?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">1. Opioids - ""I have lost friends to opioid addiction, and Pennsylvania is one of the worst states in the country when it comes to opioid-related deaths. Curing this disease of despair can be achieved only by instilling a sense of hope in our communities and providing all citizens with the ability to get ahead in life."" 

2. Student Loans - ""I have a six-figure student loan bill, so I know what it's like to be burdened by debt. Young people today can't buy a home, get married, be entrepreneurial, or give to charity. The government must offer student loan forgiveness programs to give the next generation a chance to be active participants in the economy.""

3. Foreign affairs - ""My brother is an Army ROTC cadet, and it horrifies me to think of what his responsibility will be to defend our country. Autocracy is on the rise worldwide. The proliferation of biological and nuclear weapons threaten civilization as we know it. Climate change may upend civilization by causing mass migration and widespread famine. We must adopt foreign policy that addresses the problems of our time and creates a sense of trust and cooperation among the international community.""</p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">Who are you? Tell us about yourself in 300 words or less.</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I'm the mom to a rambunctious and mischievous boy and the wife to the bravest and best man I've ever known. He's an Apache helicopter pilot for the United States Army.

I'm a graduate of Harvard Law School, where I studied the intersection of agriculture and environmental policy. As a farm girl from Saline County Missouri who watched our fields flood in '93, the changing environment has been a fixture of my life. As an attorney, I've worked on numerous environmental issues.

						    <div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Please list below 3 key messages of your campaign. What are the main points you want voters to remember about your goals for your time in office?</p>
				<ul class=""key-messages"">
					<li>Families.</li>
					<li>Fairness.</li>
					<li>Freedom. </li>
				</ul>
			</div>
							<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What areas of public policy are you personally passionate about?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Our policy priority is helping military families, working families, and farming families succeed. That includes making sure every single person has access to high-quality and low-cost healthcare, dental care, vision care, mental healthcare, long-term care, physical therapy care and behavioral care. It means investing in rural areas, bringing jobs to our towns so parents don't have to commute and so kids don't have to leave after graduation. It means making hospitals and doctors accessible. It means being a voice to veterans and active duty families who are too often overlooked. It means ending a trade war that makes collateral damage out of our family farmers. It means giving power to everyday people and valuing their voice over that of the wealthy and we'll-connected. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Who do you look up to? Whose example would you like to follow, and why?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I look up to so many different kinds of people for different reasons. But, as a child, I was desperate for strong women to embody. For me, there was Princess Leia and Queen Amidala. And Matilda and Hermione and Topanga. 

I cannot overstate the importance of having someone you identify with doing the things you wish you could do. You have to see it to be it.

As I grew up, I was in awe of our forefathers, Leonardo DaVinci, Teddy Roosevelt, and as any proper Missourian would be-Walt Disney and Harry Truman. The idea that someone could come from where I lived-a small farm town near the river-and do incredible things, was such a motivator. 

So I set off to do that myself. And when people laughed that I wanted to go to Harvard, I studied harder. And when I got in, I worked harder so I could pay for it. And after I graduated, I came home to mentor other young women and girls so they could see it-and so they could do it next.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Is there a book, essay, film, or something else you would recommend to someone who wants to understand your political philosophy?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Ike Skelton had a suggested list of books on national security to read before making decisions on national security. I've been reading through that list of 50 or so books for the past decade. I'd suggest anyone who is a student of history and believes in deliberative decision-making do the same. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What qualities do you possess that you believe would make you a successful officeholder?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Integrity.
Honesty.
Low tolerance for bullshit.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What legacy would you like to leave?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">That I did my damnedest for my community and family.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What is the first historical event that happened in your lifetime that you remember? How old were you at the time?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Technically, I was alive when the Berlin Wall came down, but I don't remember it. I have vague memories of Nancy Kerrigan getting hit in the knee during the Olympics. I remember voting for Ross Perot during our fake election at pre-school. I was probably four years old. But what I remember is having this great accessibility to all of these kinds of newsworthy events. It shaped me considerably to watch life unfold on the TV. That's something my parents really didn't have. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What was your very first job? How long did you have it?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">My family has been farming  in Missouri since before it became a state. We do mostly row crops now but used to do lots of cattle and pigs before the markets turned down. My first job was working out on that farm. I did whatever my Papa asked of me. Some days that was bottle feeding calves. Sometimes it was going out in the crisp darkness of a winter night to check on those new calves. Other times it was clearing out the pastures, detassling corn, cleaning out the machine shed or putting fence up on the back 40. I was in awe of my Papa. He worked before the sun rose and didn't come in until it had gone down. And he loved it. Never complained. A farm is so much more than just a small business-a real family farm is a home. And for too many folks in my community they're losing that home and with it a generational legacy and tradition. We're gonna bring that back. </p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">What is your favorite book? Why?</p>

Harry Potter because it encouraged me to keep dreaming.

The Lone Ranger and Tonto Fistfight in Heaven by Sherman Alexis because it taught me how to marry my dreams to action.</p>

				<p class=""survey-response"">Watching my husband deploy to wars the President says don't matter. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What qualities does the U.S. House of Representatives possess that makes it unique as an institution?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">The Constitution provides the House of Representatives the unique ability to initiate revenue bills and as we've seen recently, to impeach the President. It also has the unique ability to cast a vote for President should the electoral college tie.

But it's structure is also unique. Because elections occur every two years, Representatives are encouraged to be more in touch with their constituencies than Senators. This gives us a great ability to address immediate and timely matters-and gives us an incentive to do so. The House is so-called the People's House for a reason-our real imperative is to represent people. The Senate, prior to the Constitutional amendment to the contrary-was to represent sovereign states across the country. 

The House is Representatives is meant to represent the people. And we must do that.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Do you believe that it's beneficial for representatives to have previous experience in government or politics?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">There is a benefit to having experience representing people. As an attorney, by profession my only job is to represent the interests of my clients.

I have the added benefit of working for Congressman Ike Skelton and Senator Claire McCaskill, so I know how Congress works and I'm familiar with the tremendous importance of constituent services. But the best experience for this job is knowing how to listen to people and figure out what they want and need and then rolling up your sleeves to make it happen.</p>

					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What do you perceive to be the United States’ greatest challenges as a nation over the next decade?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">National Security.

That comes in the form of having a nation completely unprepared to deal with climate change.

That comes in the form of having a President who has sabotaged our reputation abroad and made a mockery of our troops.

That comes from having a citizenry who can not afford to see a doctor. An unhealthy population is an unhealthy country. And that makes for a weak country.

That comes from having an administration defund public schools and under-educating a generation of youth.  We cannot afford to be the last in class on the world stage.

The next decade will set the stage for which country leads the world on the most important issues this world has ever faced, including climate change, and right now we're falling behind.</p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">Both sitting representatives and candidates for office hear many personal stories from the residents of their district. Is there a story that you’ve heard that you found particularly touching, memorable, or impactful?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">As the spouse of an active duty military member, I'm running to be the first active duty spouse in Congress.

I have been incredibly touched by the outpouring of support from the military community. We had a soldier deployed to Afghanistan write to us, thanking us for helping to protect his family. He's in a war zone and felt so strongly about our mission he used his personal time to write us. 

This race is so much bigger than just me or my family. This is about all of us. </p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">What would be your top three priorities, if elected?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">My top priorities in Congress would be the following:
		Securing infrastructure investment:	I am committed to working with allies and across the aisle to get an infrastructure package completed and passed as soon as possible. These are jobs that cannot be outsourced and many are good-paying union jobs and for every dollar that's spent investing in our infrastructure needs, it pays off into the local economies quickly after.
 		Offering a Public Option Via Medicare:	Over 30% of the jobs in the 13th District are in the health care and education services sector. If we expand Medicare and offer a Public Option, this will not only provide growth to that job market but help to bring down rates to those who only have one provider in their area. Reducing these access costs is extremely important, as well as allowing Medicare to negotiate for drug prices, bringing these costs down as well. The ACA doesn't work for everyone and providing a public option would be a big step in the direction of providing affordable, accessible, quality care to the young, our elderly, chronically ill, and generally healthy.
		Expanding Education Opportunities: I believe that one of the main ways that we invest in the future of our country is by having an educated public. Whether it's K-12, community colleges, apprenticeship programs, 4 year universities, etc, we need to keep up with the global economy through educating our kids and re-training adults whose jobs are getting phased out due to automation or the unfortunate result of companies moving jobs overseas.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What areas of public policy are you personally passionate about?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">My top priority would be to address healthcare coverage and costs. First, I will work to stabilize the ACA so no one loses coverage and all Essential Health Benefits. I would also ensure that insurance companies are not able to discriminate against people with pre-existing conditions. Second, I will introduce or support legislation to allow the federal government to directly negotiate with drug companies for price discounts. I believe we should leverage the collective bargaining power of over 42 million enrollees to bring down the cost of prescription drugs. Third, I will push to introduce a Public Option -- allowing this Option, through Medicare, to bring more competition to the market of providers, beginning with rural communities and small business owners. Offering a Public Option would create competition and act as the needed measuring stick to bring the rising costs down. In addition, the 13th District must protect the rural hospitals we have and increase the availability, accessibility and affordability of substance-abuse and mental health facilities. Central Illinois is suffering from the effects of opioid prescription abuse and heroin addiction like the rest of our nation. But, in rural areas, residents have fewer options for treatment because we lack the infrastructure and comprehensive approaches necessary. Additionally, while we know that Medication Assisted Therapy can be very effective in treating addiction, the regulations on physicians are restrictive and people living in rural areas are less likely to have access to physicians who can prescribe and monitor the treatment. People have to travel further to find a physician and an inpatient or day treatment facility.

 How can the federal government help? The Center for Disease Control is updating guidelines for prescribing opioids regularly and needs to be certain the information is communicated effectively to physicians who prescribe them. The Drug Enforcement Agency has to have enough agents to enforce existing laws and root out the bad actors. We need to fully fund existing rural hospitals, expand inpatient and day treatment facilities, loosen regulation on physicians for Medication Assisted Treatment and remove existing barriers Medicaid patients face in seeking treatment.  Additionally, we need to fund post-treatment support programs for people who have sought treatment as we know this is a critical step to achieving long term health. This has to be accomplished in coordination with our state agencies and local programs. There has to be a comprehensive approach to educate people about the dangers of opioids and heroin, prevent them from using the drugs, stop those who do from overdosing and effectively help those who seek treatment.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What qualities do you possess that you believe would make you a successful officeholder?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">As a lifelong resident, voter, taxpayer and mother in this community, I know firsthand what health care access means for the families across our 14 counties. I will fight tirelessly for access to affordable, quality insurance. I will vote against cuts to Social Security and Medicare because these are earned benefits and deserve to be protected. I will work to bring good-paying jobs that build our local economies -- and people can raise their families on -- back to our communities. I am proud to be endorsed by both the Illinois Alliance for Retired Americans and Social Security Works PAC, who only endorse candidates who take protecting our Social Security and Medicare seriously. I have also earned support from SEIU, SEIU Healthcare, IBT, Illinois State Council of Machinists &amp; Aerospace Workers, AFSCME, IBEW, IL AFL-CIO, CWA, UAW, UFCW, IFT, and International Brotherhood of Boilermakers, who all know the importance of building the middle class and our local economies from the center out, not the top down. I look forward to standing up for us as your Representative for the 13th District.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Both sitting representatives and candidates for office hear many personal stories from the residents of their district. Is there a story that you’ve heard that you found particularly touching, memorable, or impactful?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I am not a career politician. I am a mother, former teacher, non-profit worker and active community member who has invested her life here in Central Illinois. I have put close to 60,000 miles on my car and held 14 Town Halls, one in each county in the district, to listen to voters. These free and open to the public forums are critical to the flow of conversation between members of our communities and the person asking to represent them--- and I will continue to hold them once elected. I am in this race to protect healthcare, Social Security and Medicare, help our kids get a good education that doesn't leave them strapped with debt and bring good-paying jobs back home. I'm asking for your vote so I can take your concerns and priorities to Washington and make some positive changes for all of us.</p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">Who are you? Tell us about yourself in 300 words or less.</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Tamika Hamilton was born in Calvert County, Maryland in 1984. Estranged from her father and born to an underage mother, Tamika was fortunate to be raised by her grandparents who she credits with first instilling in her the importance of public service. Tamika's grandmother, Geraldine, took on extra work cleaning houses, while her grandfather, Francis, worked two jobs to help provide for Tamika growing up. Tamika says she is so fortunate to have had role models in her life that taught her the importance of hard work and service to her country. Tamika's grandfather, a Purple Heart recipient for his heroic service in the Vietnam War, was the first to encourage Tamika to serve her country in the military. Within a month of graduating high school Tamika arrived at basic training for the United States Air Force.

Over 14 years of active duty in the Air Force, Tamika has been stationed at five different bases and two deployments in the Middle East as part of Operation Enduring Freedom, the United States Global War on Terror. During her 14-year military career, Tamika was awarded the Air Force Achievement Medal, Joint Service Accommodation Medal, Air Force Meritorious Unit Award, and Air Force Good Conduct Medal. Two years ago, Tamika chose to become an active Air Force reservist so she would not have to deploy with young children at home.</p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">Who are you? Tell us about yourself in 300 words or less.</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I am a proud Washingtonian, a small business owner, a home renter, and a tenants' rights organizer. I've served as a Court Appointed Special Advocate (CASA), a commissioner on the Tacoma Area Commission on Disabilities, a human rights observer in an indigenous community in Mexico, a co-leader of Indivisible Tacoma, a Board Member for Whole Washington, and a Democratic PCO. I've fought for progressive values my entire adult life, and now I want to fight for them in Congress. As a community-level volunteer and organizer, I believe that political change can and should come from the bottom up, not from the top down. The American people deserve political and economic democracy, not a political system bought by billionaires and the 1%. They deserve to be treated not as economic cogs in the machine, but as human beings who have intrinsic worth, regardless of their economic output.

				<p class=""survey-question"">Please list below 3 key messages of your campaign. What are the main points you want voters to remember about your goals for your time in office?</p>
				<ul class=""key-messages"">
					<li>In a moral economy, housing is first and foremost a human right. When there are enough bedrooms in America for all the people that need beds and yet hundreds of thousands of people - including children - sleep on the streets, something is wrong.  The primary purpose of housing is to house people. That is how I will approach housing policy in Congress. I will fight for a Homes Guarantee, including national rent control, the construction of 12 million new units of social housing, and the end of homelessness.</li>
					<li>Without a livable environment, other policy will become moot. While just 100 companies are responsible for 70% of global emissions, it's the 99% of us who suffer the consequences - and communities of color and poor communities are hit the hardest. In Congress, I will fight for a Green New Deal, including 100% use of renewable energy by 2030, a federal jobs guarantee for everyone in the new green economy, single-payer healthcare to mitigate the array of negative health outcomes related to climate change and industrial pollution, holding giant polluters criminally accountable for the willful destruction of our environment, and supporting local efforts to create change in how food is grown, processed, and delivered. </li>
					<li>I have delayed medical care due to cost. My premiums, which I pay 100% of as a self-employed person, have gone up 20% in two years. And I have it lucky. People in my district are dying waiting in line for drug treatment. They're having heart attacks because they're diabetics who couldn't afford insulin.  Healthcare is a human right, and it's time the wealthiest country on earth treated it as such. We must remove the profit motive in healthcare, end premiums, end copays, end the rapacious practices of health insurance and pharmaceutical companies, and bring the pharmaceutical industry into public ownership. </li>
				</ul>
			</div>
							<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What areas of public policy are you personally passionate about?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I am most passionate about housing policy, foreign policy, and human rights.
 
As a renter on a month-to-month lease, the protections that we at the Tacoma Tenants Organizing Committee (TTOC) won have directly improved my material security. TTOC formed after an out-of-town developer bought an apartment building, evicted everyone, and doubled the rent. That was the only place many of the residents could afford. Two have died on the streets since being evicted. Housing is life.
 
I grew up overseas as the daughter of a U.S. Foreign Service Officer, so foreign policy is something I've been interested in for a long time. As a country, America has admirable ideals, but we often fall short. We have toppled democratically elected governments and invaded countries for oil while declining to intervene in genocides. I worked for the International Association of Genocide Scholars for two years, presented its conference in Sarajevo, and visited a mass grave in Srebrenica that was still being excavated. I've seen firsthand the devastating impact of human rights going ignored, and that is something I want to remedy when I'm in Congress.

				<p class=""survey-response"">An economic democracy in which every worker has a say in their everyday lives.
</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What is the first historical event that happened in your lifetime that you remember? How old were you at the time?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I remember the Berlin Wall falling. That happened when we were living in Japan, and my mother, who is German, watched it on TV - from thousands of miles away - in disbelief.
</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What was your very first job? How long did you have it?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I worked at a children's bookstore called Aladdin's Lamp and then a Baskin Robbins for most of high school. 
</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What is your favorite book? Why?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">A Confederacy of Dunces by John Kennedy Toole, because it makes me laugh every time I read it.
</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What was the last song that got stuck in your head?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">\""Dancing in the Street\"" - Martha and the Vandellas
</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What is something that has been a struggle in your life?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Moving around a lot due to my father's work, I never felt connected to a place until I moved to Tacoma. Now that I've found a home, I want to protect it.
</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What qualities does the U.S. House of Representatives possess that makes it unique as an institution?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">It's the most democratic and populist half of the legislative branch, which is itself the most answerable to the people. I truly believe the U.S. House is the People's House. It is the lever of government by which the American people exert the most power. 
</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Do you believe that it's beneficial for representatives to have previous experience in government or politics?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Experience is a tool, and tools are useful based on how they're used. By the time many politicians gain \""enough\"" experience to be elected to the House, however, they have been completely bought off by corporations and lobbyists and, in office, work to preserve the system as it is. At this point in our history, I believe that a) coming in as an outsider to change the system and b) having lived experience of economic insecurity are valuable experiences to bring to government.
</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What do you perceive to be the United States’ greatest challenges as a nation over the next decade?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Without addressing climate change all other challenges are rendered moot. After that, we must address income inequality and money in politics. With the ability of oligarchs to buy our political system and the corrupting influence of money in politics gone, our other challenges become much easier to solve.
</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">If you are not a current representative, are there certain committees that you would want to be a part of?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Financial Services, Foreign Affairs, and a future Climate Committee that is uncorrupted by oil money. 
</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Do you believe that two years is the right term length for representatives?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Yes. The more often the people are able to communicate their will through their representatives, the more accurately they will be represented in their nation's capital. 
</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What are your thoughts on term limits?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I think that term limits would be a positive way to ensure that seats of power do not belong to individuals, but to the people. 
</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">If you are not currently a member of your party’s leadership in the U.S. House of Representatives, would you be interested in joining the leadership? If so, in what role?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Undecided. 
</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Is there a particular representative, past or present, whom you want to model yourself after?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Thaddeus Stevens.

			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Both sitting representatives and candidates for office hear many personal stories from the residents of their district. Is there a story that you’ve heard that you found particularly touching, memorable, or impactful?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">There was a grandmother I met while canvassing in Tacoma. She's on disability and receives $750 a month and food stamps. Her rent is $650 a month. How is anyone supposed to live on $100 a month for everything besides food and rent? Why do we as a society treat people as worthless if they don't have economic \""value?\"" Why do we say \""respect your elders\"" but the only respect we give them is $2 off their pancakes at IHOP?</p>

				<p class=""survey-response"">Lieutenant Colonel Buzz Patterson's service as an Air Force pilot began under President Ronald Reagan. Buzz flew in combat all over the globe, in 69 countries and over 20 years of service. It was his privilege and pledge to fight for his beloved country. Buzz was the White House military aide for the Clintons and protected America's ""Nuclear Football,"" the black bag with the nation's nuclear capability. Disgusted and appalled by the depths the Clintons went to undermine our country and our Constitution, Buzz authored two New York Times bestsellers exposing the truth behind the most irresponsible President in our history.</p>

				<p class=""survey-response"">My name is Andrew Bales.  I'm running for office in Indiana's 5th Congressional District.

			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Who do you look up to? Whose example would you like to follow, and why?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Martin Luther King was one of the greatest Civil Rights leaders of all time.  His leadership and guidance in the face of such adversity is an inspiration to me.  Through all of the protests, riots, marches and fire hoses, his message was of Peaceful Protest.
In today's politically charged atmosphere, Martin Luther King's example serves as a guide for a method of bringing about change in our country, yet I see groups in the streets blocking traffic, shutting down people's freedom of speech because they disagree with their views,  and carrying sticks, knives, and other weapons as they protest our President.  The Antifa and Resist movements could certainly learn a thing or two from Martin Luther King if they wish to ever get their arguments heard.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Is there a book, essay, film, or something else you would recommend to someone who wants to understand your political philosophy?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I would recommend first, that someone wanting to understand my philosphy toward politics would read 3 items.

1.  The Constitution of the United States, including ammendments

2.  Understanding what has happened in Countries like the former Soviet Union, East Germany, Czechoslovakia, Cube, China, and Venezuala, I want them to read Karl Marx, Communist Manifesto.  My desire would be to have them understand that Communism and Socialism has failed miserably and has had a real human toll in history.

3.  Any basic Economics book, so that they understand Capitalism, competition, and scarcity.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What characteristics or principles are most important for an elected official?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">People will laugh when they read this but, Honesty...That sounds like an oxymoron, but I believe it.  You have to be honest with your constituents up front, no flip flopping on issues or pandering just for votes.  
I've laid our my stance on a host of issues on my webpage.  People tell me that the devil is in the details, but I want people to know how and why I will do what I say.
Along with honesty comes integrity.  Not just going with the flow in Congress, but actually voting your conscience.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What qualities do you possess that you believe would make you a successful officeholder?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Considering public approval of Congress these days, I find this to be an oxymoron as well.  People might expect me to answer by saying lying, cheating, stealing, and pandering.  Unfortunatley, these seem to be the case in many instances.

I believe my honesty, my integrity, communication skills, and my leadership make me capable and the best candidate to hold this office.

</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What do you believe are the core responsibilities for someone elected to this office?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">First is to support and defend the Constitution of the United States.  Second is to make sound, informed, and wise decisions in legislating.  I must always keep my constituents in mind with every vote, and ask myself, \""Will this benefit the people in my district or my state, or my country\""? 
</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What is the first historical event that happened in your lifetime that you remember? How old were you at the time?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Our first Moon landing was in the summer of 1969.  I was 4 years old.  I remember my family and I were on vacation and staying in a hotel.  That day, we watched the events unfold on the news on a small black and white television in the hotel room.  </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What was your very first job? How long did you have it?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">My very first job was as an Usher at a movie theater.  I got the job when I was 15 years old.  Cleaning up sticky soda and popcorn stuck to the floor was my life as a Freshman in High School.  I kept the job for approximately 9 months.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What is your favorite book? Why?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Animal Farm - George Orwell

As a former educator, I loved to read this book to my class of middle school kids.  We studied US and World history.  This is an allegory which portrays the Russian Revolution of 1917 in the setting of Farm Animals taking over the farm from their human masters.  Every student should read this book to know the perils of communism and socialism.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What was the last song that got stuck in your head?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">One of the songs from the Frozen 2 CD...I have a 7 year old.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Do you believe that it's beneficial for representatives to have previous experience in government or politics?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Yes, previous experience is beneficial, but not necessary.  I believe it's better to serve as an average citizen with many life experiences similar to those we wish to represent.  I know that I can better serve my constituents because I have struggled to pay a mortgage, send my daughter to college, to pay a medical bill.  I've experienced unemployment and layoffs, and truly understand the problems everyday citizens are going through.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">If you are not a current representative, are there certain committees that you would want to be a part of?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Yes.  It's time we balance the budget and stop getting this country further and further into debt.  As a member of the US House, I would like to serve on the Appropriations and Budget Committees, or the Ways and Means Committee.
Further, I would like to join the Freedom Caucus and the Cannabis Caucus.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What are your thoughts on term limits?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I have signed the pledge with TermLimits.com

I believe there are too many members of the House and Senate who have made it their career.  Service in government was never meant to be a lifelong endeavor.  Therefore, I'm advocating for the following:

US House - 6 two year terms in Congress

Senate - 2 six year terms</p>

				<p class=""survey-response"">I am from southern Illinois and was raised on a small family farm that has been in my family since the 1840s when the Funks immigrated from Germany. My primary education was in Mascoutah Illinois. I went to college on an Army ROTC scholarship to The Citadel, the South Carolina Military College. I earned two Bachelor of Arts and a commission in the US Army as a Second Lieutenant in Aviation Branch.  

Upon graduation I attended the US Army Flight School where I was awarded the Army Aviator Badge and qualified in the chinook series of army helicopters. I have served in the 10th Mountain Division, 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault) 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment (Airborne), and 5th Special Forces Group (Airborne).

I graduated from the Army's Command and General Officer Staff College and K-State in 2017 with a Master of Arts in Security Studies. I left the Army in order to be closer to my family, assist with the family business, and to serve as a leader in my community.

				<ul class=""key-messages"">
					<li>Personal liberty is the fundamental principle of the enlightenment that our government is founded on. Liberty and its preservation against tyranny in all its forms must be assured and strengthened. </li>
					<li>Prosperity is the cornerstone of our community and country. We must achieve sustainable growth that benefits all instead of a few, which will yield a more stable and just society.</li>
					<li>Life is not a zero sum game. We all benefit by lifting up those that are less well off. Pursuing policies that ensure a person's opportunities in life  are not determined in large part by their zip-code at birth  will accelerate entrepreneurship, innovation, and prosperity for all. </li>
				</ul>
			</div>
							<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What areas of public policy are you personally passionate about?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">International relations, foreign policy, and national security affairs is what I am most passionate about. The greatest threats to our planet and our continued existence as a species are global. The rise in violent extremism, authoritarianism, and unsustainable industrial expansion dependent on non-renewable sources of energy threaten to engulf our world. Our approaches to combat these threats at the national level are myopic and must be retooled to look to the future and not near term quarterly earnings reports. In order to lead on the world stage we must be strong at home as well. Our gravest threat domestically is a socioeconomic system that further entrenches wealth disparity and leaves all except the very wealthy shackled and indentured to debt. Our economy is currently a house of cards built upon a mountain of debt and unfunded liabilities that we must address before it is too late.  </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Who do you look up to? Whose example would you like to follow, and why?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I've had many great examples of leaders and selfless servants in my life to learn from and emulate from my own family, educational institutions, and my military career.  My favorite President and a person I've looked up to not just for what he achieved, but the person he was is Theodore Roosevelt. His tenacity, drive, and pursuit to build a more just and moral society are without a doubt worthy of echoing.  As a person he was complex and most certainly flawed, but how he pushed through those flaws and sought to understand and relate to everyone in order to communicate that he was fighting for their best interest made our country stronger and more just. Someone in his likeness is what we need at the helm again. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Is there a book, essay, film, or something else you would recommend to someone who wants to understand your political philosophy?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Victor Hugo's work \""Les Misérables\"" is my favorite book. Not only is it masterfully written, but it examines and portrays the human condition in a way that I've not seen anywhere else. It is a story of loss, redemption, love, forgiveness, and devotion to others. It shows what it is to be impoverished and enslaved to a system of exploitation. It narrates the story of just revolution and the heartbreak felt by those fighting for liberty. It shows how life and humanity exist within a web of interconnectedness and influence. It is an excellent novel that I highly recommend that teaches the reader not what to think, but how to think. It was instrumental in widening my perspective about the world we live in.  </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What qualities do you possess that you believe would make you a successful officeholder?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Qualities and specific characteristics such as intelligence or charisma alone are not sufficient to determine a person's qualifications to be a leader. I am fortunate in that the institutions and organizations I attended and served in fostered development that grew the whole person. I am driven and ambitious, but not for my own sake and pure self interest. I am learned and educated, but am not condescending or elitist. I enjoy reading  and working with my hands equally.  I think the single most important quality I possess is the ability to use reason fueled by passion to examine our world and those in it in order to craft actions and plans to make it better and more just. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What legacy would you like to leave?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I want to leave the world to the next generation better than it was handed to mine. I refuse to just sit back and watch the world and our county deteriorate and not do everything I can to alter course. To whom much is given, much will be required. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What is the first historical event that happened in your lifetime that you remember? How old were you at the time?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">My first memory of a historical event was the Gulf War in 1990. I was 6.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What was your very first job? How long did you have it?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">My first job was helping my dad on our small family farm alongside my grandpa. My earliest memory was helping him bundle firewood to be sold at the local farmers market in Belleville, IL when I was 6. My grandpa has since passed, but I'm still working alongside my dad and am heading to that exact same wood shed in a few hours to get more firewood ready to sell. My first W-2 producing job was working at McDonald's in my hometown of Mascoutah when i was 16. I worked there for about six months until i finished lifeguard training and became a lifeguard at our community pool. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">If you could be any fictional character, who would you want to be?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Luke Skywalker: I can relate to a farm boy looking up to the sky wanting to fly and do his part to make a difference in the world. Being a force wielding Jedi would be pretty cool too.  </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What is something that has been a struggle in your life?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I had a serious speech impediment as a child and horrible acne as an adolescent. The resultant insecurity of those problems coupled with a resistance to conform and being a divergent thinker often put me outside the norm and lead to a difficult childhood. We are a product of our environment and how we respond to it. I would not be who I am today had those challenges not been there.  </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Do you believe that it's beneficial for representatives to have previous experience in government or politics?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">It is beneficial for representatives to have been in a position of public service in one form or another. This is not limited to just elected office, but the full range of public servants to include police, teachers, firefighters, emergency medical services, and the military.  Selfless service, giving back to the community, and experience serving something greater than oneself are essential elements of being an elected official. Otherwise we run the risk of electing officials that put their own self-interest and their friends ahead of the public good. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What do you perceive to be the United States’ greatest challenges as a nation over the next decade?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Our greatest challenge is twofold. The United States has overextended its power and resources globally in order to manage and control the world as the sole superpower. A paradigm shift is occurring and instead of strengthening alliances, utilizing international organizations, and using all elements of national power the current administration has alienated allies, used unilateral action, and has almost singular focused on military power and the threat of using it to influence geopolitics. This has weakened our position globally, ballooned our debt, and puts the world in a perilous position. We must realign our priorities, mend relationships with allies, and accept the reality that we are not the world's police force or we will follow the footsteps of other failed hegemonic states.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">If you are not a current representative, are there certain committees that you would want to be a part of?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">The committees I join should be representative of not just my strengths and expertise, but should represent the needs and characteristics of my district. My educational and professional background having grown up on and am once again working on a small family farm, having served in the military and special operations community, and am still in possession of a top-secret security clearance puts me a unique position where I can be a strong voice on multiple committees. The House Armed Services Committee, the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs, the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, and the House Committee on Agriculture would all be excellent committees to be a member of, which would benefit our district. I am a strong position to be selected to serve on any one of them.</p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">Who are you? Tell us about yourself in 300 words or less.</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I am the American dream...I was born in Puerto Rico and raised in New York; 100% American. I am not rich (when it comes to monetary value), and not poor in the slightest as I have 3 daughters and the greatest wife a man can be blessed with. I know poverty but lived like a king via the love of a mother and stepdad that made dreams possible with their wisdom and faith in God. My brothers and I have felt the sting of prejudice as we are from a black father and light skin mother. We did not fit in with anyone (at first) but with time, patience and love, we made even the stanches of critics see passed its color and towards content of character. I know loss, my mother that made darkness light up with her smile, a dad that thought me to be a man in the absence of my biological father and a grandfather that was a fighter and did not back down from the larger advisory. I have been homeless, depressed, scared and broke, but I have also leaned that negatives in the right light; created a home, happiness, bravery and riches that money can not buy. I have been a stock boy, an educator, a nanny, and currently a defender to the homeless of New York City. Now I am looking to take all that I am and bring it to my brothers and sisters of the Nation. I am Israel Ortega Cruz and I am running to be your next congressmen.  Help me reach the top and I will be there to pull you up with me. God bless you all, our leaders and these United States of America. </p>

						    <div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Please list below 3 key messages of your campaign. What are the main points you want voters to remember about your goals for your time in office?</p>
				<ul class=""key-messages"">
					<li>One nation Under God where government ensures rights not gives them.</li>
					<li>America  and Americans first does not imply all others last.</li>
					<li>Content of charector not color, creed or indentity polotics etc.</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
							<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What areas of public policy are you personally passionate about?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I am personally passionate about: 
Homelessness since my youth and since I have been homeless. 
Job creation as I know what it is like to be jobless in New York. 
Education elementary, secondary, and higher education as I am trained and continuing to be trained in education. 
The elderly since I volunteered and saw and see the value of their wisdom. 
Social Welfare such as social security and welfare which both had a say in my up bringing</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Who do you look up to? Whose example would you like to follow, and why?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">The greatest president short from Donald J trump in policy but in speech the greatest of all time...Ronald Reagan he was a man that knew how to sling a joke with all parties wanting to hear more. But in my life, I look up to the one he looked up to...Jesus Christ who knew to have it all and give it up to represent His father and serve His fellow man even till His death. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Is there a book, essay, film, or something else you would recommend to someone who wants to understand your political philosophy?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">The Bible. In this book you will find Real Good and evil so that we may stop treating each other as if we were evil and know that one is truly good, but God. You will also find respect for parents and family and to love the stranger in our mist and never mistreat anyone as we are all equal in God's eyes no one greater or lesser than the next. That the government that you live under should be respected and its laws but that you have the right to demand changes if they do not align with the rights given by God and only watched over by Government. It shows to render unto the leaders their share but to always do so with a heart that is not greedy, hateful and lacking will. It shows to care for enemies but when they continue to attack you that smiting them is allowed as well so long as it is the last resort or to prevent a greater damage to the nation. It shows mores but I don't want to ruin it for you...Go read it yourself.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What characteristics or principles are most important for an elected official?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Their word...My stepdad told me once that he had nothing but that he had it all. I did not understand this, so he explained.  he started by saying we are poor we don't have much when it comes to earthily things, but we have God and as humans we have something, he gave us that we can leave the earth with, and that is our word. we will be remembered by it and judged the same. Thus, anyone let alone an elected official should hold true to it. hold true, that their word be the greatest thing that they have. As everyone may hate you for your views but everyone, even your enemies will respect you if you know how to keep it. You doing so when alive, may not change the world however, it may light the fire in that one person who will maybe after your gone... much like Jesus did for us.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What qualities do you possess that you believe would make you a successful officeholder?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Since a young age I have had the what (at first, I thought was a discomfort but now I know as a) privilege of always having to hear people's problems. I thought it was a curse for strangers to come up to me and tell me their lives even family and friends but now I understand that God was training me to be receptive to those around me. to have a heart via firsthand knowledge as well as anecdotal. I was being groomed to represent those whom the party that said cared for us left behind. So, I walked away to learn to care and as well as do. To say what was wrong and not sit on my hands waiting for another to do it. Thus, what makes a successful office holder is someone who doe sit because it is inherent and never for money. (Don't get me wrong becoming rich is allowed so long as it is never at the expense of another. Then and only then are you a true success.     </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What do you believe are the core responsibilities for someone elected to this office?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">To follow the oath to the letter of the law, to try every day to surpass the limits of their jobs (when it comes to what good they can do). to love everyone as if they were the lost family member you could not live without. if all those elected thought this way, we would have a better world.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What legacy would you like to leave?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">The legacy that I served much like our fallen soldiers did for glory but not for self, people, family or country but of God. That everything I do is to raise my heavenly father and my fellow mankind up to a higher stand than they would have been had I not served. that when I leave this earth that all member of every party says there was a man that had principles and lived them with no exception. that is the legacy I want that and that I leave a family that is above reproach not for my sake but on their own merits.   </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What is the first historical event that happened in your lifetime that you remember? How old were you at the time?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">The very first historical even I remember watching is President Ronald Reagan being sworn in. I had no idea what I was watching but I felt happy watching it. I have been attracted to politics since I was that age.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What was your very first job? How long did you have it?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">If it is at home, it would be serving and cleaning up after my brothers. I did that till I was 14 where I got a job for pay at the summer youth program. I may say that was both hard and fun. I made friends that I still have till today.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What is your favorite book? Why?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Other than the Bible, Sun Zu the art of war! This from a person who loves peace...though I have been in many a fight in my youth (for self-defense purposes)</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">If you could be any fictional character, who would you want to be?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Batman as he likes to help and clean up the streets all with out anyone knowing who he is and why he does it. draw back is he is lonely and I have my riches in the form of a core family that loves me and I them.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What was the last song that got stuck in your head?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Matthew West \""do something\""</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What is something that has been a struggle in your life?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">To forget the great losses, I have had which make me stronger in passing through them but week in drive at times. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What qualities does the U.S. House of Representatives possess that makes it unique as an institution?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Other than having the power of the purse, the house is the only body that sheds member and gains them fast as well as having the honor of people the closes to the population of the people. their main goal is to understand the Needs of their constituents and lead them by experience learn often outside politics.  </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Do you believe that it's beneficial for representatives to have previous experience in government or politics?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Not necessarily but it is useful for them to have a grasp of both the inner working of their job and that of the community they serve which can be achieved by learning and living experiences. I personally understand the plight of teachers as I have been one, homeless as I have been there, the elderly as I have been around them to learn, and economic in a macro level as I have attempted a business or two and many lines of work with their educations needed to maintain them. One can learn on the job but also if one listened well to others who have been there.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What do you perceive to be the United States’ greatest challenges as a nation over the next decade?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">The greatest challenge to any nation, let alone the USA is its ability to be cohesive, and assimilate all parties in to one nation. We may be a nation of many but as the founding fathers envisioned (E plurbus unim) out of many one. What many do not understand is that that fact, that job and honor belongs to the children of the of previous generation. They are the ones whom grow together and blur the lines of color, creed, religion etc. the unity is made by them and destroyed by the older generation if left to their own devices. This is our greatest challenge letting youth do their jobs.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">If you are not a current representative, are there certain committees that you would want to be a part of?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Labor, Health and Human Services, Education and Related Agencies
Military Construction, Veterans Affairs and Related Agencies
Transportation, Housing and Urban Development and Related Agencies
Early Childhood, Elementary and Secondary Education
Health, Employment, Labor and Pensions
Housing, Community Development and Insurance
Oversight and Investigations

				<p class=""survey-question"">Do you believe that two years is the right term length for representatives?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Yes!... as the will of the people changes fast and the House must be able to keep up with it as it goes up and down, in and out, stays still and moves in intervals.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What are your thoughts on term limits?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I believe that term limits keeps the house fresh and keeps lazy good for nothing people away.  I will be my own judge and say that I think 12 years in office should be the limit as to many people use the office as a cash cow and become corrupt. therefore, term limits will hinder how much these wannabe heroes (which are really wolves in sheep's clothing). Thus, I want term limits...one can always run for different jobs like senators and then president and then after you very old a mayor of a little town till you die or like jimmy carter and do good with the name you made for yourself.  </p>

					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Who do you look up to? Whose example would you like to follow, and why?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I hold President Abraham Lincoln in the highest high regard and can think of no other president in our nation's history whose example I would most like to emulate. During the time he worked as a politician, the United States was deeply divided over the issue of slavery. Despite strong geographical differences of opinion, he found a way to use the powers of government to reset the country's moral compass. As the United States once again enters an epoch of hyper-partisan politics, I'm reminded of Lincoln's unwavering resolve. It has inspired my search for issues that have the potential to unite and propel our nation into a leadership role on the international stage. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Is there a book, essay, film, or something else you would recommend to someone who wants to understand your political philosophy?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">John F. Kennedy's Profiles in Courage can help someone who wants to understand my political philosophy better. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What characteristics or principles are most important for an elected official?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I believe that the most important principles for an elective official are honesty, integrity, courage and commitment. These were some of the core values that I heard while attending Officer Candidate School in the United States Marine Corps. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What do you believe are the core responsibilities for someone elected to this office?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">The core responsibilities for someone elected to the House of Representatives are to be present for votes on Capitol Hill, to be accessible and responsive to constituents back home in the congressional district, to fundraise through small donors (not PACs and large contributors alone), and to vote for and create policy guided by the values that you were elected with.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What legacy would you like to leave?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I would like to leave a legacy defined by forward-thinking selflessness in the name of generational change. </p>

			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What qualities does the U.S. House of Representatives possess that makes it unique as an institution?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Unique to the U.S. House of Representatives are powers to formally indict the President of the United States (impeachment). Tax and revenue bills also originate in the House, and this is critical when considering $1.3 trillion discretionary dollars. Lastly, the hierarchical structure of the House leads to centralized decision-making that is efficient at getting bills to move along. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Do you believe that it's beneficial for representatives to have previous experience in government or politics?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Previous experience in government or politics is not necessary for representatives. As their title indicates, their effectiveness should be determined by how well they represent their constituents and are readily accessible to them. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What do you perceive to be the United States’ greatest challenges as a nation over the next decade?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">The United States' greatest challenge will be to assume a leadership role when it comes to setting international expectations for climate change resilience. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">If you are not a current representative, are there certain committees that you would want to be a part of?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">The committees I would like to be a part of include: Agriculture, Appropriations, Education and Labor, Energy and Commerce, Natural Resources, Select Committee on the Climate Crisis, and the Select Committee on the Modernization of Congress.</p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">Both sitting representatives and candidates for office hear many personal stories from the residents of their district. Is there a story that you’ve heard that you found particularly touching, memorable, or impactful?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">As a House candidate, the most impactful story I've repeatedly heard is that constituents can not get a response from their current representative. By simply responding to emails and messages on social media, future constituents are extremely grateful for making myself accessible and responding in a timely manner. </p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">Who are you? Tell us about yourself in 300 words or less.</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">My name is Elisa Cardnell and I'm a Navy vet, single mom, and teacher running for Congress in TX-02 against Dan Crenshaw.  Ever since I was born on an Army base, service has been a part of my identity. After 9/11 I joined the Navy ROTC at Rice and served 5 years active duty.  After my deployment I developed a pre-existing condition, and stepped down from active duty to join the Reserves. I found my calling in the classroom and continued to serve my community as a teacher. But while I was teaching I watched as Republicans tried to take away healthcare coverage for pre-existing conditions and did nothing about soaring drug prices. I left the reserves in April of 2018 and didn't know where to put all my energy. I saw numerous great female vets run and win, and thought that was something I could possibly do. But it wasn't until election night in 2018 when I saw Dan Crenshaw, a far right Republican, run and win in my district with less than 53% of the vote. It was then that I knew I had to step up and serve again. </p>

						    <div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Please list below 3 key messages of your campaign. What are the main points you want voters to remember about your goals for your time in office?</p>
				<ul class=""key-messages"">
					<li>Strong and safe schools</li>
					<li>Fix our healthcare system</li>
					<li>Get corporate money out of politics</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
							<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What areas of public policy are you personally passionate about?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I am personally passionate about fighting for our schools, our healthcare, and our democracy. As a teacher, I watched as high-stakes standardized tests took the creativity and critical thinking out of my students. At the same time it created a system of tests that better measure socio-economic status resulting in us underfunding our low-income community schools.

I also have multiple pre-existing conditions and have watched the skyrocketing costs of prescription drugs over just the past few years. We need universal, affordable healthcare and to lower prescription drug costs. No one should go bankrupt because they got sick. 

Finally, I swore an oath to protect our Constitution from enemies foreign and and domestic. Right now our democracy is under attack both by foreign actors who would influence our elections, and domestic actors who would rather be complicit than hold them accountable. At the same time, corporate money is polluting our elections and preventing anything from getting done in Washington. We must tackle Washington's corruption if we are going to protect our democracy.

				<p class=""survey-question"">Who are you? Tell us about yourself in 300 words or less.</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I am not a career politician nor ever thought to be one. When I learned that no one was stepping up to run against the current Representative for my district, whom many are not happy with, I came forward to run.  I believe that I am better in touch with what the people of my district want and need. I have many life experiences that will help to my shape my public service decisions. 
I am currently a teacher for Cincinnati Public Schools and I reside in Cincinnati's easternmost neighborhood Mt. Washington. I taught full time before marriage and kids, but took a break from teaching to raise my kids. While at home with them, I started a small business creating sewn projects for clients ranging from individuals to large businesses.  I learned a lot about the challenges small businesses face. Three years ago, I returned to teaching part time.  While my previous full time teaching job was teaching English at the high school level, now I work with all grades Pre-K through 12, teaching various subjects including gym, art, music, and often with small special needs groups. I have worked in various schools with many students and teachers. This dynamic job has given me an unique view as to many educational successes and areas needing improvement.
I am from Greenhills, Ohio and am one of five children. Both my parents worked for the city of Cincinnati but are now living in Adams County Ohio.  My life spreads across our district and I want to be present throughout it and stay in touch. </p>

						    <div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Please list below 3 key messages of your campaign. What are the main points you want voters to remember about your goals for your time in office?</p>
				<ul class=""key-messages"">
					<li>Expand single payer healthcare with the goal of universal healthcare for all (including mental healthcare)</li>
					<li>Reform school loan financing with an expansion of federal subsidies for public service and healthcare service </li>
					<li>Expand and create programs to aid rural Americans with improvements in healthcare access and job creation and training.</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
							<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What areas of public policy are you personally passionate about?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">As a teacher, supporting public education is very important to me. We need to rely on educational experts as to the best ways to serve teachers and students. 
Access to healthcare, medicine, and mental health services must be improved.  We need more healthcare professionals and better proximity to services. 
Environmental protections must be strengthened not deregulated. I will not sell out to big business at the cost of pollution. 
Gun violence can be decreased if all parties come to the table to discuss ways to help. Strengthening background check implementation and instilling red flag laws are ways to start. 
Women's Rights must be protected. Instead of trying to control women's bodies, standardized sex education based on science and health needs to be created.  Access to birth control in the form of an over the counter birth control pill would also help decrease the amount of unplanned pregnancies.
Many other reforms are needed: criminal justice, immigration, campaign finance - all of these have been dirtied by for profit agendas. We need to put people first! </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Is there a book, essay, film, or something else you would recommend to someone who wants to understand your political philosophy?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">No.  I am still discovering.  Maybe I need to write a book?</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What characteristics or principles are most important for an elected official?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Integrity
Diplomacy
Intelligence
Empathy
Adaptability
Being a good listener
Being effective (following through with legislation that had positive results for the people and country)
I like to see a good sense of humor too - it shows a person's humanity.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What qualities do you possess that you believe would make you a successful officeholder?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Integrity
Diplomacy
Intelligence
Empathy
I am a fantastic listener
I get things done
I have a good sense of humor too

Truly - I do not think that I am corruptible and that is a very good start.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What do you believe are the core responsibilities for someone elected to this office?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">A person elected to this office must always put the interest of the people first. Country before party, country before big business, country before your religious views, country above self. Too often elected officials put agendas first that are based on selfish reasons. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What legacy would you like to leave?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">If I only serve one term but do it with such integrity and empathy, fighting for those who haven't been heard... if I get to Washington and always side with the people regardless of my future campaign contributions from corporate interest, then I have done a worthy job. I have no political ego nor big pictures of me in some lofty position.  I have been thrown into this situation but am doing it willingly and fearlessly because people need a choice and people deserve politicians that are not corrupt. I want my legacy to be as a honorable, brave servant of the people. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What is the first historical event that happened in your lifetime that you remember? How old were you at the time?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">The first historical event that happened in my life that I remember was the Challenger explosion.  I was in the fourth grade (age 9) which is the same age that my son is now actually (which helps to put things into perspective better).  It was a big deal to watch happening live as my teacher was super excited about the Challenger because of there was a civilian teacher on board named Christa McAuliffe.  She was chosen from thousands of applicants and was living out so many people's dream.  We had a big old box TV's up on a  corner shelf above the chalk board and we turned on the news channel that best came through.  We sat on the floor Indian Style (criss-cross applesauce we call it now!) and all stared up in anticipation and excitement. It really is something to see a shuttle launch.  However, it is something all together different to see a shuttle launch and then seconds later blow into pieces.  I remember we all looked immediately at our teacher for understanding , but she fell apart.  There were a lot of tears.  We cried hard for the humanity lost. 
Fast forward to 2001.  I was teaching a 10th grade English class when a cell phone went off.  Accusingly, I looked at my students but they all shook their heads.  It turns out that it was my phone (it was my first cell phone and was newly acquired).  My best friend called to tell me of the terrorist attacks in New York knowing that I had family there.  That day I rolled a big old box TV into my classroom and played footage of the news all day.  I told my students that this day they would remember for the rest of their lives.  Many did not get the humanity of it then. I hope that they, looking back, do now. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What is your favorite book? Why?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">The Joy Luck Club by Amy Tan is my favorite book.  That book destroys me every time - the way that female relationships are depicted so excruciatingly beautiful and difficult and true tears me apart.  The sacrifices that the mothers make I could feel before I became a mother but now that I have children, I feel so much stronger how mothers will do anything for their children.  Before I was the annoyed child, but to hear the words \""I see you!\"" still does me in.  We all just want to be seen and heard.  And we want our loved ones to be safe.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What is something that has been a struggle in your life?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Oh man - this is hard because I see other people struggle just to survive so my personal issues seem fluff. 

I think though, it is something that I have been witnessing personally.  I would say that the biggest struggle that I have gone through is watching my mother struggle with mental illness and trauma.  

You could make a movie or write book based on her life and it would not be a feel good one.  I did not know about any of her life trials until my early 20s as she hid it from us and wanted us to have a happy carefree childhood.  
My mother was born is Brooklyn in 1944.  Her parents were separated but her father snuck into the hospital and wrapped her up in a newspaper to try to take her away.  He was caught and she was returned.  Her mother suffered from MS and they lived with my mother's  grandparents. They were not happy that they were caretakers.  My mother never felt wanted and I never heard her say that she felt loved.  At 18 she married the first nice guy that asked as her grandfather would not allow her to move out with friends or go to college.  That husband hit her after he brought home a STD that she asked about.  She always felt controlled and threatened.  She had two kids with him but was widowed at age 23.  She met my father and saw a promise of an easier life.  It did get better but her pain was never healed.  When I was five, she took a lot of pills.  It was a cry for help I think and she began therapy shortly afterwards.  Her therapists were never good.  They threw a lot of pills at her but never trulyl listened. I'm 42 now and she still isn't well - she has PTSD  and I fear she will never be healed.  </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What qualities does the U.S. House of Representatives possess that makes it unique as an institution?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Being a Representative by definition means that the people that vote for you entrust you to make the best decisions that effect their lives.  A person with this position needs to listen to their people and stay in touch with their needs and struggles. A person needs to be accessible and not hide from criticism nor complaint. This position is unique as it should be the purest reflection of the voice of the people.  </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Do you believe that it's beneficial for representatives to have previous experience in government or politics?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">In the sense that a person understands rules and processes, it can be beneficial to have previous experience.  But those things can be learned before serving and not having previous experience should not be a hindrance. What you do get with a political newcomer is fresh energy and insight free from the things that can corrupt like political alliances and bought-for allegiance.   </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What do you perceive to be the United States’ greatest challenges as a nation over the next decade?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">The people as a nation need to rid themselves of the toxic political divide as that alone is inhibiting our progress.  There is so much corrupting politics right now: Big Money, special interests, political egos, corporate/capitalistic interests over people/workers/environment - we are being divided so that we are weak. Once we can come together, we can address so many problems and make reforms across the board to improve the life, liberty, and happiness of all Americans. We need to realize that we do not live in our own bubble though too. We need to work with other nations to create a healthy world in regards to environmental threats, trade deals, and in keeping peace. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">If you are not a current representative, are there certain committees that you would want to be a part of?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I would be honored to serve on any committee and would give my all to learning and listening to experts on any issue. My first choice would be serving on the Education and Labor Committee as I feel my professional background and having a teacher's point of view will be highly beneficial to informing decisions made here. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Do you believe that two years is the right term length for representatives?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I struggle with this as it was set as such in the Constitution. However the challenge that occurs is that you get one solid year of service which may be a lot of learning the job if it's the first term for a person. The second term is muddied with having to worry about campaigning again to win another term. Solutions to this predicament would be to lengthen the term to 3 years or even better, to reform campaign financing. If each candidate can only raise a certain equal amount or be given an equal stipend, then there would be less financial burden for candidates. That would also allow more people to run for office that were previously held back due to income obstacles. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What are your thoughts on term limits?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I am 100% for them on every level.  Term limits would help end corruption and allow for better representation of the people. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Is there a particular representative, past or present, whom you want to model yourself after?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Past Representative Jeannette Rankin's work for Women's Rights stands out to me as she was elected at a time when women were not even allowed to vote and then went on to introduce legislation that would become the 19th Constitutional Amendment. 
I am watching a lot of the women that are new to Congress that have come from nontraditional backgrounds, but it is too soon to point to any specific person just yet. I admire that each ran for Congress and we're elected which demonstrates great bravery and personal strength. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Both sitting representatives and candidates for office hear many personal stories from the residents of their district. Is there a story that you’ve heard that you found particularly touching, memorable, or impactful?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I have begun to travel across the eight counties of this district and my intentions is to listen and learn. Generally, people feel like their voice is not heard whether they live in the most populous portion of the district or the most remote.  So far I have heard many touching stories but I will not use them as a political prop. </p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">Who are you? Tell us about yourself in 300 words or less.</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Over two decades ago, I immigrated to this country as a student searching for the American Dream. I found it here in the heart of our Bay Area while studying for my MS and MBA at Santa Clara University. I believe this community is the greatest in our nation and it angers me to see the Washington D.C. elite ignore our values of strong family devotion and hard work. It will be my top priority to represent you, not entrenched party bosses.

As a former President of a non-profit, I see how many Bay Area families are struggling to make ends meet. As a father, I know the $23-trillion national debt is stealing our children's future. As an independent small businessman, I understand the crushing burden of job-killing regulations. 

You can count on me to champion smart and efficient health care that will alleviate the financial strain on working-class families. I also support immigration policies that protect us, while expediting the process for law-abiding residents that contribute to our economy. We must also have real education reform that gives our students more choices in school and in the workforce.

I am running for Congress because I am grateful for all this community has given me and I want to serve you. Let's work together, reject partisan politics and find common-sense solutions to ease the burden on all Bay Area families.

I'm thankful for the love and support of my wife of 19 years, Zurica.  I would appreciate your vote.

				<p class=""survey-question"">Please list below 3 key messages of your campaign. What are the main points you want voters to remember about your goals for your time in office?</p>
				<ul class=""key-messages"">
					<li>Economy: Protect Silicon Valley Companies, Less Corporate Taxes, Low Regulation. Give working families a break. No Discrimination at workplace and Equal rights for Women</li>
					<li>Development: Create better educational opportunities for our children, support our immigration community and pass real healthcare reform with support for pre-existing conditions</li>
					<li>California Issues: Solution for Homeless, Alleviate Bay Area Traffic Congestion, Help build more housing and SUPPORT PROP 13  for residence/businesses</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
							<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What areas of public policy are you personally passionate about?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">@ Protect Silicon Valley - We need to protect the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. Today historic low unemployment number 3.4% and historic high Dow Jones Industrial average 2800+. Democrats like to reverse the same to fund their socialist program. I like to give more break/incentives to companies

@ Education - No for Affirmative actions during college admission. I like every child to compete and get admitted to colleges based on Merit. My opponent RO Khanna tried for Affirmative action, which is highly unfair

@ Immigration -Law-abiding immigrants wait over a decade to receive their green card. We need an immigration system that promotes hardworking contributors and prioritizes reuniting families.

@ Housing and Support Prop 13 - We need to be more efficient, economical and creative in permit issuance, to make life easier for people who like to build. I strongly support Prop 13 for home and businesses, at same time support expanding Prop 13, so people can move without an increase in property taxes, which will generate more revenue and jobs for real estate people, banks and everyone involved in the process

@  Homeless Issues - California's skyrocketing housing costs and lack of investment in mental health services, has made California the homeless capital of the United States. 49% of our nation's unhoused homeless live in California. We are in a state of emergency. Today CA state govt is not seeking help from Federal Govt. and homeless people are unnecessary suffering</p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">Who are you? Tell us about yourself in 300 words or less.</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I'm a lifelong public servant, a former government official for the State of New York, and a mother to a young daughter. I'm running for office because, at a national level, we're facing an imminent threat to our democracy. We have a criminal Commander-in-Chief that no one on either side of the aisle seems to be able to hold accountable. At a local level, in New York City, we're living in the most unequal district in the nation in terms of wealth distribution, which is unacceptable for a city thought of as the beacon of progressive values. 

My career has been a training ground in making ideas like the Green New Deal, Federal Paid Family Leave, Housing as a Human Right, and Free Community College a reality. I've created hundreds of millions of dollars in jobs for working families across New York; worked to get Chambers of Commerce across the state on-board in the fight for a $15 minimum wage and paid family leave; oversaw New York's disaster relief efforts when Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico; and negotiated hundreds of millions of dollars in funding for NYCHA in the state budget when Congress failed to act. 

We need leaders with the moral courage to put country over politics and get to work. I've seen the insider's game first-hand and am angry and frustrated when machine politics gets in the way of solving the crises we're facing. I'm running for Congress because I want change for Americans, and I have the experience, the guts, and the fortitude to do something about it.</p>

						    <div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Please list below 3 key messages of your campaign. What are the main points you want voters to remember about your goals for your time in office?</p>
				<ul class=""key-messages"">
					<li>Climate Change: We can and must pass a Green New Deal. Many areas across this nation are one extreme weather event from total devastation. We must stop the intentional harm we are doing to the planet, and ourselves, by leading the way in 100% renewable energy and putting resources in place to protect areas besieged by climate disasters. It is time to re-think what it means to build equitable cities as we face the irreversible damage that has been done to our planet.</li>
					<li>Mental Health: I grew up in a family that struggled with Mental Health. It wasn't until I started talking about it more publicly that I realized how many families, like mine, are impacted by suicide, addiction, depression, and other mental health issues that end in tragedy. Our country is in crisis; we must treat mental health on par with physical health in the fight for Medicare for All.</li>
					<li>Protecting our Democracy: It is imperative that Congress move forward with impeachment. Our President makes efforts to thwart democracy in plain sight. Neither Republicans nor Democrats should look the other way for fear of being voted out of office. It is time to put country over politics and do what's right to uphold our progressive values.</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
							<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What areas of public policy are you personally passionate about?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Mobility: NY-10 is one of the most unequal districts in the nation in terms of wealth distribution. In our country, every generation should have the opportunity to thrive - to be as successful, if not more, than the generation before. This extends across having a safe place to live, access to a quality education, a living wage, and affordable healthcare. We need to restore the American Dream and ensure everyone has the opportunity to succeed.</p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">Who are you? Tell us about yourself in 300 words or less.</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">A servant of the people is simply who I am. Putting more of your paycheck in your pocket; fixing the social security insolvency problem and getting govt OUT of our lives so we can all have the Liberty of Happiness, from Life. Being the ONLY candidate who has written on the back AND the front of a paycheck will be the change YOU need and want. I was fortunate to have been raised in a Christian home &amp; have carried that on to own children. Everyone deserves a real chance for a continued and thriving free-market economy and a chance at personal success without govt interference. That's the American way and that's what I am all about.</p>
			</div>
						    <div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Please list below 3 key messages of your campaign. What are the main points you want voters to remember about your goals for your time in office?</p>
				<ul class=""key-messages"">
					<li>The federal govt is to be small and limited in size. We need to return to that.</li>
					<li>The absence of a budget by Congress is inexcusable. </li>
					<li>The free and open market, for ever industry, when left to operate is the most impressive economic engine on the planet. </li>
				</ul>
			</div>
							<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What areas of public policy are you personally passionate about?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">A full and proper budget is key and necessary. Spending cuts and elimination of waste. The Federal government must get OUT of the healthcare business and let the open and free markets flourish. Businesses and people alike must be able to buy whatever kind of insurance they want, from wherever it is sold. Competition breeds a better product. We have an actual PLAN to make social security solvent again. Again, using free market based long term investments, future generations will not have to worry about retirement. (Those already retired or nearing retirement will not have to worry about losing what they've paid in)  Elimination of the Federal Income Tax and complete reform of the tax code with a \""Fairer Tax\"" will allow workers to keep MORE of their wages in their pockets. A \""Fairer Tax\"" system will coincide with the elimination of payroll tax. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Who do you look up to? Whose example would you like to follow, and why?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">There are several people I have looked up to. My father because of how he was the patriarch of our family; working 2 and 3 jobs to make sure we had what he and Mom thought we needed. His ethic and integrity have been NEVER in question and I greatly admire that. I looked up to my grandfather in his life as a businessman. I do believe it formed some of what \""made\"" me the entrepreneur that I became. My grandfather was a strict belief in taking care of your customers. \""Give them even more than they want, and they'll never leave you. \"" \""Expect that you should be paid well, because if you do it better than everyone else, why shouldn't you be paid well\"". </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Is there a book, essay, film, or something else you would recommend to someone who wants to understand your political philosophy?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I reflect on and use often, many quotes from Barry Goldwater form the 1960's because of his positions on elected officials and the overall size and position of the Federal govt. Barry Goldwater and I both have said --- \""we don't want to go to DC to make it more efficient or streamline it.... we want to go to Washington to make it less intrusive in all of our lives.\""</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What qualities do you possess that you believe would make you a successful officeholder?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I am a communicator and try to use only the highest of values of integrity, honesty and transparency in not only my political career but also in my work and professional career and especially as a husband, father, and grandfather. I am a common man, in very uncommon times.  I believe in building and expanding relationships. There is NO ONE I will not talk with. There has even been a bit of \""tongue in cheek\"" on my time on County Council with my colleagues; \""If you need to get in touch with any of us, just call COvert as he always answers his phone and email. If we need to see it, he will tell us\"". While that is and has been, quasi-funny, there is a badge with that statement that I wear proudly. Complete Customer Service.....whether you are a customer of my business or a customer of my District-- I respond to all. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What is the first historical event that happened in your lifetime that you remember? How old were you at the time?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I am not sure about the FIRST historical event, but as a teen, I was a volunteer EMT with the local Rescue Squad. NOt only was I learning life-saving techniques and performing community service but I also was experiencing life-altering moments that would be a part of my life forever. There were two BIG events that happened during my years there; the first was performing CPR on a \""human\"" who was suffering from a heart attack and the second was delivering a baby in the back of an ambulance when I was 18. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What was your very first job? How long did you have it?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Very first job was a \""bag-boy\"" at a Safeway Grocery store, where I got paid. I learned a lot as a teenager and could NOT believe it the day I was promoted to \""Cashier\""! I enjoyed working there in my teens for 3 or 4 years</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What is your favorite book? Why?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">\""The Water is Wide\"" by Pat Conroy. This book and the subsequent movie, \""Conrack\"", is a beautiful story of the SC Lowcountry and sea islands and not only the southern plantation folks, but also the story of the Gullah and Geechie people that are native to this land.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What qualities does the U.S. House of Representatives possess that makes it unique as an institution?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">The US Constitution simply lays out the details and responsibilities of the US House. Unfortunately, over time we have drifted away and expanded the size of the govt, against the wishes of the Founders. The US House has distinct responsibilities-- it is though responsibilities that we must return to. Uniqueness will return when we do the job the voters sent us there to do.  That begins with a budget.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Do you believe that it's beneficial for representatives to have previous experience in government or politics?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Not necessarily, although there is a wise argument for saying \""yes\"", thus eliminating the long \""growth curve\"". It should be possible, however, that ANYONE is able to make a case for themselves to run for office, at any level. For me, having had roles in Tax Commissions, County Councils, School Improvement Councils etc and having served on national committees writing white papers for Federal legislation, that curve will be minimal.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">If you are not a current representative, are there certain committees that you would want to be a part of?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I would enjoy being a part of  Small Business; Armed Services; Foreign Affairs and  Energy and Commerce.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Do you believe that two years is the right term length for representatives?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">yes</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What are your thoughts on term limits?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I have signed a Term Limits pledge of no more than 3 terms in the US House if elected.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">If you are not currently a member of your party’s leadership in the U.S. House of Representatives, would you be interested in joining the leadership? If so, in what role?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Yes, as I can be of service.</p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">What areas of public policy are you personally passionate about?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Growing up in a rural area, my access to resources was limited and my family struggled to make ends meet. We relied on programs such as Free School Lunch, Medicaid and Food Stamps to survive. As a first-generation college student, I was fortunate to receive grant scholarship money, but I still had to work and take out loans to pay rent, buy food and afford textbooks. I know I am one of the success stories; I was able to able to pull myself up by 'my bootstraps.' But it was incredibly difficult and for every success story there are many more who don't make it because the deck is stacked against them. I am campaigning on issues that can make a difference in the lives of Utahns. We need to champion causes and policies that prioritize people over profits. I am also passionate about rejecting the politics of fear and hate that pervade the status quo. Utahn's are compassionate people and our values are not being represented by our politicians who remain impervious to public sentiment. It is time to elect someone different - someone who will listen to her constituents and will tirelessly work to make their lives better.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What do you believe are the core responsibilities for someone elected to this office?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">There are several challenges the United States is facing in the next decade. And our current administration is not doing enough to address enough of them. However, there are three that are more pressing than the others.
Addressing Climate Change - The Earth is literally dying from the decisions of this administration and their inability to recognize our contribution to greenhouse gas emissions. In fact, it has been made worse by the Trump Administration pulling out agreements like the Paris Agreement and fighting the rights of states to add their own regulations. 
Free and Fair Elections - Our elections are being attacked by foreign governments. We must pass legislation to protect our the fairness of our elections and update the security around the technology used for our election process. 2016 should be a warning to all of us that we need to do more to protect our election process. Additionally, our election maps need to be addressed as gerrymandering is rampant and do not allow for fair representation of voters. We need to support states to make appropriate changes to their election maps to allow for fair elections.
Income Inequality - Our middle class continues to feel the squeeze of corporate greed. The current administration continues to remove supports for our most vulnerable Americans and we need to increase access and resources to the people who need it the most. The 1% continues to control most of the wealth in this country (and the world) and we must do more to eliminate it.</p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">What was your very first job? How long did you have it?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">My first real job was working for my family's small business: Audrey's Entertainment. This business was a video store that my mother started with her parents in my small town of Newcastle, WY. I was hired and starting helping day one in 1999; this included inventorying and organizing all the videos and video games and adding all movies to our computer system. I started there at minimum wage and worked 20 hours a week while still going to high school and engaging in after school activities. This job allowed me to pay for gas and insurance for my car, my cellphone bill, and cover all my extra cash needs since I did not receive an allowance. My mother, the namesake of the business, passed away in 2003 and we continued to business and I worked there for over 5 years until I went off to college. In terms of a small business in a small town, it was very successful. However, due to the advancement of technology and the changing landscape of video rentals, Audrey's did eventually go out of business. It was not able to compete with things like Redbox or Netflix and was eventually pushed out of the market. I now have a very personal example of why we need to make sure no one falls behind when technology changes the landscape of business, we need to allow business to change and grow and not get lost in the shuffle.</p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">What was the last song that got stuck in your head?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">As a mother to a toddler, I think I share the same song as many other parents: Baby Shark (doo doo doo doo doo doo)...This song is amazingly catchy and has very fun lyrics, including talking about Moms, Dads and Grandmas and Grandpas! I love that my child can both sign and do the actions and she gets so much joy from both! She can literally listen to this song on repeat a dozen or more times in a row.
She especially loves this song in her weekly dance class. She gets to run around while signing it and also gets to engage with others her same age. My husband and I feel strongly about enrichment for Audrey and really enjoy the opportunity these classes provide for her.</p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">What is something that has been a struggle in your life?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">When I was 16, my mother passed away from cancer suddenly. She was diagnosed with aggressive colon cancer at the young age of 36. She went to the doctor on New Year's Eve and she passed away on January 23rd - she only knew she was sick for less than a month. In fact, when she went to the hospital the last time, she told us it was her gallbladder, but it was actually her liver and she never came home.
Losing a parent is a life altering experience and even more so in my case. My parents divorced when I was in 8th grade and my brother and I lived with our mother in Wyoming while our father moved to Idaho. My mother was my universe and when she passed, literally everything changed for me. My brother and I were forced to leave our home and move into a different trailer that was paid for by our grandmother. It took my dad several weeks to be able to move his life back to Wyoming, so my brother and I lived by ourselves and continued to go to school and be as normal as possible.
Not having my mother for almost half my life has impacted me in so many ways. I have been on my own for a very long time and had to grow up basically over night. When I left my home to go to college, I never looked back because the 'home' I knew was gone forever. I had to pay my own way through college, which despite scholarships and PELL grant, I still had to take out student loans in order to meet my basic needs. I was able to graduate as a first generation college student, but it wasn't without a lot of struggle - it took me 6 years to earn my bachelor's degree.
I missed my mother the most when my husband and I made the decision to start our own family. I had no one to talk to about my pregnancy or to alleviate my fears of birth. I was lucky that my mother-in-law filled in some of that role - but there is nothing that can replace that bond of when a daughter becomes a mother and a mother becomes a grandmother. I decided to honor my mother by giving my daughter her name: Audrey.</p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">Do you believe that it's beneficial for representatives to have previous experience in government or politics?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I believe that all experiences are beneficial to representatives. I would agree that having experience in government or politics would be beneficial for a representative. This experience can help a representative understand the process of how legislation gets translated into actual services for the people that need them. However, I would argue that it is not necessary experience to have to be successful in office. 2018 showed us that anyone can be a successful candidate no matter their background. If our government is supposed to be for the people, by the people, then average people should be able to run and participate in the political process. I think career politicians frequently lose touch with their constituents and we need new, unique perspectives to all parts of our legislative process.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What do you perceive to be the United States’ greatest challenges as a nation over the next decade?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">There are several challenges the United States is facing in the next decade. And our current administration is not doing enough to address enough of them. However, there are three that are more pressing than the others.
Addressing Climate Change - The Earth is literally dying from the decisions of this administration and their inability to recognize our contribution to greenhouse gas emissions. In fact, it has been made worse by the Trump Administration pulling out agreements like the Paris Agreement and fighting the rights of states to add their own regulations. 
Free and Fair Elections - Our elections are being attacked by foreign governments. We must pass legislation to protect our the fairness of our elections and update the security around the technology used for our election process. 2016 should be a warning to all of us that we need to do more to protect our election process. Additionally, our election maps need to be addressed as gerrymandering is rampant and do not allow for fair representation of voters. We need to support states to make appropriate changes to their election maps to allow for fair elections.
Income Inequality - Our middle class continues to feel the squeeze of corporate greed. The current administration continues to remove supports for our most vulnerable Americans and we need to increase access and resources to the people who need it the most. The 1% continues to control most of the wealth in this country (and the world) and we must do more to eliminate it.</p>

					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Do you believe that two years is the right term length for representatives?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I agree that two year terms are the right length for a Representative. While it does force these politicians to campaign almost constantly, I think this is good for the political process. This term length makes those elected officials hyper-responsive to their constituents. It also allows voters the ability to vote for a change when one is needed. The House of Representatives is unique in that every single one of them has to be re-elected every 2 years and you can have a large swing from one party to another. This can easily be seen with the 2018 elections, known as the 'Blue Wave,' which was largely seen as a referendum on the current administration. Imagine if those limits were 3 or 4 years? We would still be wallowing in a Republican controlled house, senate and presidency. These limits are critical to a successful Democracy.</p>

			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Who do you look up to? Whose example would you like to follow, and why?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I look up to my dad and my uncle, for different reasons. My dad was a single parent and we lacked for nothing. We always felt loved and supported. We had a home cooked meal every night. For years we watched every NY Knicks game together. He gave me my love of the game. As a parent I don't know how he managed to be everywhere and do everything at once. I also admire my uncle the Honorable Judge Ricardo Urbina. Upon his appointments he became the first Latino appointed to the Federal Bench in Washington D.C. and the Superior Court for the District of Columbia. He is truly a scholar and a gentleman. He exercises the utmost care with everything he does and always downplays the bravery he has displayed shattering the barriers aimed at limiting Latinos and people of color professionals in the legal profession.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What characteristics or principles are most important for an elected official?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Our campaign is grounded in 3 values. Honesty, Inclusion and Family. I believe it is necessary for elected officials to be completely and brutally honest with their constituents. This doesn't just mean transparency (not talking behind your back) it means honesty (telling you to your face). To have a productive discourse, everyone has to be on the same page and honesty is essential for setting this foundation. I am a proponent of being as inclusive as possible. This stems from my up-bringing as the sister of a child with disabilities. My definition of inclusion further broadened as I grew into my own as a member of the LGBTQ community. Affirming identities and experiences and elevating  stories is core to my campaign. Inclusion requires work and intentionality. I want constituents to push me to be as inclusive as possible. Lastly, family is why I do everything I do. Chosen family is included in my definition of family. I want to promote policies that strengthen and support all families to live their best lives.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What qualities do you possess that you believe would make you a successful officeholder?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I have a proven record of going above and beyond in service of others. I think you have to be willing and generous with your time. I also think you have to be open to course correction and critical feedback. It is important to allow the community to lead you and not to impose your will on anyone.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What is the first historical event that happened in your lifetime that you remember? How old were you at the time?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">One of the first historical moments I remember watching as a child was the inauguration of Nelson Mandela as the democratically elected President of South Africa. My mother told me that I should try to commit not only the image but the feeling to memory as his leadership was born out of unyielding hope and love for his country. I have carried this moment with me my whole life as I have an unyielding hope and love for my country and I want to leave this world in better shape than when I received it.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What is your favorite thing in your home or apartment? Why?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">My favorite thing in my house is my book collection. I have books from when I taught elementary school, I have books that are meaningful to me as a mother and a leader. I have books that have been passed down to me and books that were read to me in my youth. I have my book collection on display in my living room so it can be shared with friends, family and visitors.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What was the last song that got stuck in your head?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">My son is obsessed with Old Town Road, so that is most definitely been in my head as of late.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What do you perceive to be the United States’ greatest challenges as a nation over the next decade?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">The greatest challenge our country is facing is climate change. It is the greatest threat to our national security and impacts every facet of public policy, foreign and domestic. This is why I support the Green New Deal.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Is there a particular representative, past or present, whom you want to model yourself after?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Shirley Chisholm is my Congressional Icon. She was brave and audacious and never lost sight of the goals she set out to achieve for her community. I admire her unapologetic nature and her charismatic spirit. Like myself, her early story of public service consists of being an educator and organizer. She fought to expand the electorate for Puerto Rican New Yorkers who were disenfranchised by English Language tests at the polls. She maintained her dignity and values including visiting notorious George Wallace in the hospital and later working with him to secure a minimum wage for domestic workers.</p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">What areas of public policy are you personally passionate about?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I like small government, and especially as expressed in our Constitution which is really an elegant solution if we would just follow it.  The idea to give the citizens themselves the responsibility for self governance but with an overarching set of principles in our Bill of Rights to prevent any cities, towns, or states from deciding to take away these sacred rights.

I was born in a country founded on principles of Fairness, Equality and Justice.  I was brought up understanding that things of value are not easily obtained, and that staying silent in the face of injustice has never provided long term solutions.  The silence of the world in the face of injustice only serves to undermine our own liberties.</p>

				<p class=""survey-response"">Environmental Policy: Climate change. 
i.  I believe addressing climate change is the paramount issue of our time.  If the earth sustains damage that we cannot correct during our lifetime we will have failed future generations to come.
Immigration Policy: Family separation. 
i.  I support the idea that there is a need for comprehensive migration policy reform to address prohibited entry into the United States but separating families must cease to be a practice.
Equality Policy: Equal rights for women.
i.  I stand shoulder-to-shoulder with women who are not given the recognition they deserve.  Women are equal to men in every way.
Housing Policy: Affordable housing.
i.  I propose a resolution to address the issue of affordable housing similar to the income tax bracket schedule.  More specifically, units pricing would be dependent on number of bedrooms, rent reasonableness or fair market value (whichever is less), and profit caps.
ii.  Methodology and the formal policy proposal shall follow the March primary.
iii.  Property owners/landlords should be able to earn income from income from rental properties, but it needs to be reasonable and earnings must be federally regulated.
Criminal Justice Policy: Reentry into society policy reform.
i.  It is often said that criminal offenders must pay their debt to society for the crimes they commit, but once repaid those same individuals deserve a second chance. 
ii.  If offenders are not given an opportunity to become prod</p>

						    <div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Please list below 3 key messages of your campaign. What are the main points you want voters to remember about your goals for your time in office?</p>
				<ul class=""key-messages"">
					<li>Our elected representatives have failed to address the out-of-control government spending and debt accumulation. We must balance our budget and begin paying off our debt immediately!</li>
					<li>Power continues to consolidate into the federal government and executive branch at an alarming rate. I will strive to restore that power back to the people and the states they live in.</li>
					<li>I will fight for the virtues of capitalism and defend it against the rising threat of socialism on economic, historical, philosophical, and ethical grounds.</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
							<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What areas of public policy are you personally passionate about?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I began this campaign because our federal government has mutated into an unrecognizable monstrosity, a shadow of its former republic. Many of our Republican elected representatives speak of conservatism but are little more than red Democrats-big government, big spending politicians. I believe it is our duty as American patriots to run for office, remove these career politicians, and restore authority to the constitution.

My dive into politics begin in 2012 when I joined the campaign to elect Congressman Ron Paul for President. I was motivated by my background in economics and out of hope that America might address the monetary issues that threatened our prominence as a world power. Today, as a U.S. Congressional candidate, I seek to address this threat directly in Washington D.C. and restore fiscal conservatism to the federal government.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Who do you look up to? Whose example would you like to follow, and why?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I have great admiration for our founding fathers who had a unique opportunity to seize power but instead created the greatest constitutional republic in the history of civilization. Thomas Jefferson is my favorite founding father. More modern role models include Dr. Jordan Peterson, Dr. Ron Paul, Thomas Sowell, and Ben Shapiro.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Is there a book, essay, film, or something else you would recommend to someone who wants to understand your political philosophy?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Conservative economists and the Austrian School of Economics - Ludwig Von Mises, Murray Rothbard, Ron Paul, Thomas Sowell, Friedrich Hayek, Frederic Bastiat</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What characteristics or principles are most important for an elected official?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">The embodiment of the underlying principals in which our Constitution was derived: life, liberty and property. An understanding of the brilliance in a small, limited government is also paramount.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What qualities do you possess that you believe would make you a successful officeholder?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">My devotion to the cause of liberty and limited government is uncompromising. My oath to defend the constitution will be steadfast, come what may. I have no faith in these elected politicians and unelected bureaucrats to defend our republic. My resolve will make me a successful officeholder and coalition builder.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What do you believe are the core responsibilities for someone elected to this office?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">To uphold one's oath: Defend the Constitution, no matter what. As a representative it is also my responsibility to serve my constituents and their needs as Missourians.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What was your very first job? How long did you have it?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I first started working for Chick-Fil-A when I was 14 years old. Shortly after I began my career in software engineering and digital media, which I have been involved with for 16 years now.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What was the last song that got stuck in your head?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">\""Toss A Coin To Your Witcher\"" was a embedded in my brain for way too long...</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Do you believe that it's beneficial for representatives to have previous experience in government or politics?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Our founding fathers envisioned a House of Representatives that was routinely occupied by normal citizens in short spurts, who would serve their term(s) then return to their vocation. The career politicians that have become mainstream threaten our republic and continue to erode our constitutional liberties for the sake of re-election and the accumulation of personal wealth and power. No, I don't advocate for political experience in our representatives.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What do you perceive to be the United States’ greatest challenges as a nation over the next decade?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Our exponentially increasing national debt and annual spending deficit are the greatest threat to America, its citizens, our national security, and our prominence as a great world power. The removal of the debt ceiling and the constant increases in spending is a bi-partisan pursuit that will inevitably extract a reckoning. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">If you are not a current representative, are there certain committees that you would want to be a part of?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">It's going to take a lot more than committee participation to address the overwhelming spending addiction Washington D.C. suffers. But I will serve wherever I can to make a positive difference, big or small.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What are your thoughts on term limits?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">This must happen as soon as possible. The current representatives are more inclined to vote themselves a pay increase than limits to their terms which is why it is very important normal citizens answer the call and run for office. As a representative of Missouri, I respect our statewide term limits and look to it as a model for the federal government.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Is there a particular representative, past or present, whom you want to model yourself after?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Dr. Ron Paul, though I am my own man.</p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">Who are you? Tell us about yourself in 300 words or less.</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">My name is Raymond Lenzi. In my life I've been a coal miner, a professor, an economic developer, a husband, and a father- but now I'm aiming to be something different entirely. I'm running for US Congress in Illinois' 12th congressional district. I am Southern Illinois, born and raised; a true child of this place we call home. I was an anti-war protester in the 60's as a student, and was eventually elected Student President at Southern Illinois University Carbondale. I have since traveled the globe continuing my mission for peace. In my 20's I started a daycare facility and preschool for migrant children in Cobden, IL. When I got my Ph.D I was a professor of rural economic development at Washington University in St. Louis, doing many projects that benefited the state, until my lovely wife to be, Maggie, convinced me to come back to Carbondale. I am so glad that I listened. I became the Executive Director of the Office of Economic and Regional Development at SIU and founded the SIU Research Park. Subsequently, I became Vice Chancellor of the program. After retirement, I had always wished to find a politician I could support whose values reflected mine, but alas. No such thing occurred. And so, I came upon the conclusion that I was in the best position to authentically represent my own values- which I believe to be directly derived from Southern Illinois.</p>

					<li>Southern Illinois deserves representation that has longstanding and genuine relationships with its residents.</li>

				</ul>
			</div>
							<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What areas of public policy are you personally passionate about?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Climate Change action now! Southern Illinois deserves a Green New Deal! All people deserve some form of Universal Healthcare. Women's Rights are Human Rights and women are the backbone of the Democratic Party. We favor international multi-lateral action in nearly all matters of national security and military intervention. This means an end to foreign wars that are wasteful of American resources and American soldiers lives. A major public infrastructure bill is long overdue for our area. Mike Bost and the Republicans forced through a multi-trillion dollar tax cut for the Super-Rich to pay off his Koch Brother billionaire donors. \""We the People\"" favor using those dollars for a massive ten-year Public Infrastructure bill to build, repair and rebuild conventional infrastructure for highways, bridges, airports, river levees, schools and other public infrastructure. Such an infrastructure bill should also include direct funding as well as expansion of tax credits for solar, wind and all renewable energy. </p>

					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Who do you look up to? Whose example would you like to follow, and why?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Susan B. Anthony.  My favorite quote of hers is, \""The older I get, the greater power I seem to have to help the world; I am like a snowball-the further I am rolled the more I gain.\"" and it's true! I am also a fan of Abraham Lincoln. He was a true man of the people, totally accessible to the public, and his debate style has always made an impression on me.</p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">Is there a book, essay, film, or something else you would recommend to someone who wants to understand your political philosophy?</p>

			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What is something that has been a struggle in your life?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">My birth father was a WWII veteran. Shortly after the war and my birth he committed suicide. I tend not to talk about it much, but it has been deeply motivating toward the creation of my policies on protecting and caring for those who have served and continue to serve in our armed forces and my ceaseless quest for peace. I understand, better than most, the cost of war on those who are caught up in the whim of those who'd dare to wage it.</p>

					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What do you perceive to be the United States’ greatest challenges as a nation over the next decade?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Imminent Climate Catastrophe is the most serious threat to our safety as a nation and as a species globally. It has already touched every area of foreign and domestic policy and I wager that effect to grow as time moves on.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Do you believe that two years is the right term length for representatives?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I do not believe that two years is the correct term length for a representative. It is no wonder that people in Congress can't get anything done! Our electoral system forces these people to be in constant states of fundraising and campaigning in order to maintain their seats. It becomes much more about holding onto their power than about wielding it in any beneficial way.</p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">What would be your top three priorities, if elected?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Lower Taxes, Free market solutions, improve public education</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What areas of public policy are you personally passionate about?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Education.  As a private educator for many years in Maryland, I see the danger and harm of public education that is disconnected from its real purpose to improve learning and development students.  The problem is lack of accountability and transparency that would afford parents and citizens quality improvements through choice and competition.  Non-government, innovative alternatives are crushed out by a repressive form of censorship and monopoly that is far removed from any meaningful accountability or participation in the free marketplace of ideas.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Who do you look up to? Whose example would you like to follow, and why?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I look up to those persons who have challenged power with the courage of truth.  Besides the central figure of Jesus Christ, there are other more recent figures, such as Gandhi in India, and our own George Washington, father of the United States of America.  In education, pioneers such as Dr. Maria Montessori, have made historic breakthroughs for a ""new education"" in their time and place.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Is there a book, essay, film, or something else you would recommend to someone who wants to understand your political philosophy?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">In my field of Montessori teaching, I have published a Danbury audio cd and study guide, which lays out innovative technology for following laws of nature with children - a major breakthrough for a better humanity in the world.  My political philosophy follows closely the philosophy of commitment to laws of nature, which are the foundation of our country, and a sound basis for true peace and harmony in any political scope of activity.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What characteristics or principles are most important for an elected official?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Commitment to truth and integrity is the basis of ethical action and sound judgment that will bring the best results for all citizens in the end.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What qualities do you possess that you believe would make you a successful officeholder?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I possess a commitment to truth and ethical action that is the  basis of character for sound action in any political situation.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What do you believe are the core responsibilities for someone elected to this office?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">First responsibility is a commitment to principles of truth and ethical, honest dealings that holds what is good for ALL as the main premise for all action as a public official.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What legacy would you like to leave?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I would like to leave a legacy of sound, practical ideas that will move government to follow laws of nature in service to the best interests and well-being of all for peace, prosperity, and freedom.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What is the first historical event that happened in your lifetime that you remember? How old were you at the time?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">At age three, being surprised when I caught a chipmunk in my hand.  What I learned is that sometime trying to do something that seems ""impossible"", reaching out, you can actually surprise yourself with success to actually achieve it in reality.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What was your very first job? How long did you have it?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I had a paper route - delivering papers in the neighborhood.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What do you perceive to be your state’s greatest challenges over the next decade?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">The greatest challenge in Maryland is for government is reduce its size and burdensome tax and control system over ordinary citizens - defeat the corruption of machine-style special interest politics that has driven out and discouraged so many citizens in our state.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What do you believe is the ideal relationship between the governor and the state legislature?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">The idea relationship between governor and legislature is one of close working communication and search for solutions that respect the overriding purpose of what is best for all citizens in the state.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Do you believe it’s beneficial to build relationships with other legislators? Please explain your answer.</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">It is important to build relationships of trust and respect among other legislatures - to find commonground wherever possible to move forward ideas into reality that are good for all.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What process do you favor for redistricting?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">A non-partisan commission for re-districting is ideal, even if not entirely practical.  In reality, any such commission must include some participation from the legislature as well as appointments by the governor.   Ultimately, the governor and legislature must resolve political differences; but a nonpartisan commission is a good place to begin to hopefully follow the logical guidance that is already built into the mandate for district boundaries.</p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">Who are you? Tell us about yourself in 300 words or less.</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Mayor Katie Witt is a community leader, wife, mother, and woman of faith who is committed to preserving freedom, expanding opportunity, and reigniting American Patriotism.

Katie spent most of her childhood growing up in Utah where her father covered the Utah State Legislature as a journalist for the Associated Press. Through this experience, Katie developed a strong respect for public service and Freedom of Speech.

As people of faith, Katie's parents provided real life lessons in what it looks like to stand for freedom by housing refugees fleeing from Communist countries. Katie learned firsthand how an all-powerful government tries to crush the human spirit. Following her term in city government, the Witts moved to Kaysville, Utah where Katie created the innovative local online community Kaysville Condensed to show people how their local government works. Additionally, Katie was elected President of the Kaysville Rotary.

Tapping into the passionate following she created through Kaysville Condensed, Katie Witt was then elected Mayor of Kaysville in 2017 where she is demonstrating bold leadership by creating Kaysville's first-ever 20 year comprehensive plan that secures road and building improvements, expands broadband, and increases opportunities for all residents, without raising taxes.

				</ul>
			</div>
							<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What areas of public policy are you personally passionate about?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I am passionate about our technology policy. Our current leadership does not understand how technology works and many still believe technology is an unnecessary aspect of American life. Technology, more specifically - the internet, has become an essential aspect of social and economic development.   As healthcare costs rise, insurance companies have been dictating what treatments are best suited for patients instead of doctors. Healthcare should not be a for profit endeavor to benefit shareholders.   South Florida prides itself on the beauty of its beaches and diversity in its wildlife. We need to take swift action to clean our waters, make clean energy our primary source of energy, do what we can to minimize our carbon footprint, bolster our disaster response to promptly restore normalcy after extreme weather events, and work with developing nations to use clean environmental practices so their industrial practices do not affect our environment.</p>

					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What characteristics or principles are most important for an elected official?</p>

			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What do you believe are the core responsibilities for someone elected to this office?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">The budget is a reflection of the values and priorities of an elected officials' constituency. It is imperative for an elected official to listen and understand the concerns of the constituents so the representative may translate those concerns into line items that support the various agencies whose programs will best serve the community. </p>
			</div>

				<p class=""survey-question"">What is the first historical event that happened in your lifetime that you remember? How old were you at the time?</p>

					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What qualities does the U.S. House of Representatives possess that makes it unique as an institution?</p>

			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Do you believe that it's beneficial for representatives to have previous experience in government or politics?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I believe there is a benefit to having previous government or political experience, but it is not an essential aspect of governance. A representative must be able to bring expertise in subject matters that affect the community and be a public servant, not fulfilling a self-serving agenda. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What do you perceive to be the United States’ greatest challenges as a nation over the next decade?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Addressing the ever-evolving technological landscape which poses a threat to our democracy and even our perception of reality. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">If you are not a current representative, are there certain committees that you would want to be a part of?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I would prefer to be a part of the committees on Science, Space, and Technology and Transportation and Infrastructure. </p>

			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What are your thoughts on term limits?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I believe representatives should serve no more than three terms in office. Many representatives go into office with a set of ideas for the era in which they entered office.

I told her that most Centroamericans are not Spanish spoken but indigenous; they use their own tribe language and is very difficult even for Spanish speaking people to communicate with them. 

Anyways, this teacher's dedication is what America is all about, it's to help immigrants to assimilate and love our country.

				<p class=""survey-question"">Who are you? Tell us about yourself in 300 words or less.</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I'm a former journalist , marathoner, three time breast cancer survivor, and founder of The Donna Foundation and 26.2 With Donna dedicated to helping underserved families facing breast cancer. I'm running for Congress to bring back civil discourse and ensure health care as a right.</p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">Please list below 3 key messages of your campaign. What are the main points you want voters to remember about your goals for your time in office?</p>
				<ul class=""key-messages"">
					<li>Health care is a human right</li>
					<li>The climate crisis must be addressed</li>
					<li>I believe in the 2nd amendment  and common sense gun reform</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
							<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What areas of public policy are you personally passionate about?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I was anchoring the news in my hometown of Jacksonville, Florida when I was diagnosed with cancer not once but three times. I started a blog to connect with other women and began hearing horror stories of those choosing food over medicine. I started  The Donna Foundation and a marathon which draws people from all over the country to raise money to help with their critical needs. 17 years later I'm still hearing those stories. No one should have to make that choice.  It's the number one reason I'm running. I'm passionate about making sure everyone has access to affordable health care.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Who do you look up to? Whose example would you like to follow, and why?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">So many people. It's hard to choose one. My personal mantra is love over fear and I suppose the person who most embodies that for me is MLK Jr.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Is there a book, essay, film, or something else you would recommend to someone who wants to understand your political philosophy?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I just finished a book called The Obstacle is the Way by Ryan Holiday. It's based on the stoics and how they approached life. I think it translates. Bottom line I think we need more emotional intelligence and less reactionary flailing.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What characteristics or principles are most important for an elected official?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Authenticity and transparency</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What qualities do you possess that you believe would make you a successful officeholder?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I'm a good listener. I'm authentic with people. I love to learn and I'm good at boiling down issues to bite sized pieces. I'm dedicated to service.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What do you believe are the core responsibilities for someone elected to this office?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I think you need to listen to the people of your district and act in their best interest. In my campaign  I'm holding a number of town hall meetings or listening tours to connect with voters.  The question I always get is \""do you promise you won't sell us out to the special interests?\"".  It's my job as a representative to be their voice in the house. Not that of lobbyists.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What legacy would you like to leave?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I want a better world for my children and their children and if possible a world without cancer.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What is the first historical event that happened in your lifetime that you remember? How old were you at the time?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I remember vividly when we landed a man on the moon in 1969. I was 8 years old.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What is your favorite book? Why?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Love is Letting Go of Fear
It's the book that was recommended to me by a doctor after my third diagnosis. I call it a 12 step program for fear addicts. Great for cancer patients but these days I think the entire country could benefit.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What is something that has been a struggle in your life?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I suppose you could say cancer was a struggle. After my third diagnosis I changed everything about how I was living. My diet. my job.  and most especially my mindset. Ultimately though I credit cancer for changing my world in a positive way. It's enabled me to help people and see beyond myself. I also recognize how precious time is. I'm running because I've been given the gift of time. I want to use it to help as many people as I can.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What do you perceive to be the United States’ greatest challenges as a nation over the next decade?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I believe extreme partisanship is tearing us apart. The challenge we must face is how to see the humanity in each other again.  I worry that unless we learn how to once again disagree agreeably, we won't meet the needs of the people. 

Climate is something we must address over the next decade. From national security, to our economy, to the fate of our children and grandchildren. This one won't wait.

Health care must be addressed. In ten years we'll be looking at health care costs estimated between 40 and 50 trillion dollars. It's neither sustainable nor moral.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What are your thoughts on term limits?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I think term limits are a great idea. In fact, I would commit to them myself. I don't think any representative needs to spend more than 8 years in Congress.  We have a system now that simply promotes doing nothing and running to keep the seat. I think the majority of Americans find it frustrating and I believe it's a big reason many people are  disengaged.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Both sitting representatives and candidates for office hear many personal stories from the residents of their district. Is there a story that you’ve heard that you found particularly touching, memorable, or impactful?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I was recently speaking with a woman who is facing stage 4 breast cancer. She told me she found a a lump years ago but didn't seek treatment because in her words \""I didn't want to bankrupt my family\"". Now she's facing much steeper bills and probable death. Her story is one of so many that I carry with me.</p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">Who are you? Tell us about yourself in 300 words or less.</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">My name is Amy Phan West. I am running for US Congress in California. I am a proud Vietnamese refugee. My family fled the oppressive communist regime in Vietnam and we came to America legally. I therefore oppose socialism in all its forms and support legal immigration.  I am a proud conservative lady that wants to be your Congresswoman and fight for your rights. I love President Trump and will be his biggest ally in Congress once I get elected. He has worked tirelessly to Make America Great Again and I will help him to continue to do this. I am not a career politician and am not backed by big money. I am a wife, mother, small business owner, Commissioner of Personnel Board, Commissioner of OC Parks and a delegate for the CAGOP. I will uphold our Constitution and always protect our right to bear arms. I will always put America and Americans first.</p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">Please list below 3 key messages of your campaign. What are the main points you want voters to remember about your goals for your time in office?</p>
				<ul class=""key-messages"">
					<li>I want to take the lead on closing the illegal immigration loopholes that exist within our current Federal Immigration law structure today. Illegal immigration causes our country to lose hundreds of millions of dollars and California is one of the hardest hit states in this regard. I understand that turning around the economic situation in California is closely associated with the illegal immigration crisis in the state. </li>
					<li>I am very passionate about tackling the abysmal public education system in California, that is K-12 education. The public-school education in California is one of the worst in the nation and the Democrats have let this go on for too long. I believe that education is a basic human right and is the greatest gift we can give to our children. We cannot let our children be left to fend for themselves in the decaying education system of California. I have concrete plans that will bring a change and make California's education system one of the best in the Nation, like it was in the 1950's and 1960's. I am against the leftist indoctrination of our children in the schools and I will ensure this stops. I also support parental rights in terms of educ</li>
					<li>Homelessness is a blight on California and unfortunately, thanks to the Democrat rule over the past few decades, California is exhibit A in the nation for homelessness. This is an issue that can easily be resolved if the people in charge desire to want to change it. I am determined to change it, if nothing else, to stop California being referred to as the Homelessness capital of the nation.</li>

			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Who do you look up to? Whose example would you like to follow, and why?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I look up to George Washington, Abraham Lincoln and Ronald Reagan. I would like to follow their example because they were great leaders and changed our country for the better. That is what I aim to do as well.</p>

			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What characteristics or principles are most important for an elected official?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">An elected official needs to be in touch with his/her voters and work to ensure their interests are met. The person should have integrity and determined to uphold promises that were made to the people before the election. The person should also have great foresight in order to be able to predict long term effects of policies and policy changes.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What qualities do you possess that you believe would make you a successful officeholder?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I am passionate about the issues I want to get fixed and will fight hard to achieve them. I have strong Christian and family values and am proud to be an American. I firmly believe in our Constitution and will ensure that it is upheld, along with our rights and freedoms. I have integrity and believe that my responsibility lies in ensuring that the people that elected me have their interests well represented. I am diligent and really do study issues deeply before I form an opinion. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What do you believe are the core responsibilities for someone elected to this office?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Work to ensure voters' interests are upheld and keep promises that were made. America and Americans need to be prioritized. Long standing issues need to be resolved. Important issues need to be resolved. Elected officials need to uphold our Constitutions and our freedoms.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What legacy would you like to leave?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I want to be known as somebody that fought for the American people to ensure that their rights and interests were protected. I want to ensure that this country is in a better position when I leave than when I found it. I want to be known as a champion of individual freedoms and capitalism.</p>

			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What is your favorite book? Why?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">One Nation: What can we do to save America's future by Ben Carson. I love this book because it highlights an issue that is serious and one we must safeguard against.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What was the last song that got stuck in your head?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">N/A</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What is something that has been a struggle in your life?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Escaping the communist regime and coming to America was a harrowing experience. We were embraced in America but my family and I struggled to make it here. We did not have much and we had to start our lives all over again. We worked very hard to get success and there were many times where we were not sure that we would survive. That was the biggest struggle I have had to endure and it made me a stronger person. I know I have the spirit to fight for the American people.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What qualities does the U.S. House of Representatives possess that makes it unique as an institution?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">It has the power, if utilized correctly, to ensure that a capitalistic and democratic world survives and flourishes inspite of the dangers of tyranny, communism, autocracy, etc.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Do you believe that it's beneficial for representatives to have previous experience in government or politics?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I believe there should be a good mix - representatives that have previous experience in government that can provide a mentoring role for the newly elected representatives. Representatives without previous experience bring a fresh perspective and different ideas, both of which are needed since long time representatives risk being part of the establishment and remaining static and stale.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What do you perceive to be the United States’ greatest challenges as a nation over the next decade?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">The rise of socialism is something that concerns me greatly. We also need to take measures to stay ahead of foreign threats that are aiming to displace America and thereby threaten democracy. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">If you are not a current representative, are there certain committees that you would want to be a part of?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I would like to be part of committees that tackle Immigration Reform, Veterans Affairs, tackles homelessness, addresses Health care and manages Trade policies.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">If you are a current representative, why did you join your current committees?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I am not a current representative.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Do you believe that two years is the right term length for representatives?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Yes.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What are your thoughts on term limits?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I believe in term limits. A person gets 5 terms for the House, 3 terms for the Senate. 3 terms in the Senate will give a Senator 18 years of service and that is plenty of time for them to make changes for the betterment of their constituency/nation. It also gives time for the next generation of Senators to develop and be ready to take over leadership.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">If you are not currently a member of your party’s leadership in the U.S. House of Representatives, would you be interested in joining the leadership? If so, in what role?</p>

			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Is there a particular representative, past or present, whom you want to model yourself after?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Abraham Lincoln - he was a great man and is one of the greatest President's of America and worked for the welfare of America and Americans, which is what  I want to do.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Both sitting representatives and candidates for office hear many personal stories from the residents of their district. Is there a story that you’ve heard that you found particularly touching, memorable, or impactful?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I have met with several people from my district and been touched by many of them. Particularly touching was the story of a Veteran who had served in the Vietnam war. Me being a former refugee from Vietnam, this really hit close to my heart. I was very thankful to him for his service to America and truly, for Democracy fighting against the forces of Communism. I was sad to hear about the issues he had to face after he came home, including PTSD and lack of appropriate health care for him. I will do my best to ensure that our Veterans, who sacrificed so much to safeguard our freedoms, are taken care of. We owe this to them as Americans and this is one issue that is very important to me and I will fight for it.</p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">Who are you? Tell us about yourself in 300 words or less.</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">My name is Jerry Dickinson - I am a professor of law, a housing rights activist, a husband, and a father. 

I am running for Congress because for too long government and our politicians have been run for the benefit of the privileged few. While corporate profits go up, wages stay down. While healthcare companies thrive, people suffer. While certain neighborhoods are celebrated for their charm, others are left to decay until predatory developers swoop in. While the fossil fuel industries rake in profits, our air and water are choked by their pollution. 

Enough is enough.  

I was born into the Allegheny county foster system and grew up in Shaler with my ten other foster and adoptive siblings. Together, we have struggled through many of the same difficulties that ordinary Pennsylvanians face every day: joblessness, homelessness, illness, addiction, and incarceration. I have been inside prison walls pleading for fair treatment for my siblings. I have helped them struggle with drug addiction. I have watched as they worked two and three jobs at a time trying to make ends meet. 

For decades, the same old politicians have played the same old politics. It's time for change. 

We need to act boldly and urgently to confront the crises we face. We cannot wait any longer. I will fight each and every day for a better tomorrow for all, through healthcare reform, combating the climate crisis, and working for a more equal, more just tomorrow.

						    <div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Please list below 3 key messages of your campaign. What are the main points you want voters to remember about your goals for your time in office?</p>
				<ul class=""key-messages"">
					<li>It's time for our government and our politicians to work for everyone and not just the privileged few. While the incumbent takes hundreds of thousands of dollars from the fossil fuel and energy industries and executives, my campaign is built solely on individual contributors like you.</li>
					<li>Our district and our nation are facing crises that require bold, urgent action - such as on healthcare and climate change. This is not the time for sitting on the sidelines. Together, we can make Pittsburgh a leader and push for real change and real progress across the nation through Medicare for All and the Green New Deal.</li>
					<li>From fair wages to fair schools, we need to root out the systemic inequalities that plague our country. I will fight to break up the concentrations of wealth, power, and privilege that allow the few to prosper while the rest of us are left behind. </li>
				</ul>
			</div>
							<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What areas of public policy are you personally passionate about?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Much of what I am most passionate about is rooted in the struggle for equality and justice. Since my college days and throughout my law career, I have fought for housing rights on behalf of those in need - from squatters in the slums of Johannesburg, South Africa, to helping found the first community land trust in the historic Hill district here in Pittsburgh. I have long been an ally and advocate for LGBTQ+ and women's rights and even more so in light of recent attacks on those rights by the Trump administration.

I am also fiercely passionate about the two most urgent crises that face us: healthcare and climate change. As the father of a beautiful young daughter, I know that we need to act now to make things right. Healthcare costs are out of control and industrial pollution is poisoning our air and water and causing our climate crisis. There is absolutely no time to waste on making both Medicare for All and the Green New Deal a reality. 

Finally, as a constitutional law professor, I aim to curb the rampant abuses of the Trump administration and rebuild the foundations of our government. We can and we must make government work for everyone and not just the few. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What do you perceive to be the United States’ greatest challenges as a nation over the next decade?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Today, our country faces unprecedented crises - healthcare, climate, affordability, equality, to name a few. What we need now is bold, urgent action. We can't afford to wait for change. 

If we don't act now on climate change, the repercussions will ripple outwards for generations to come. I believe that we need to strive to make the Green New Deal a reality for everyone. We need to strive for carbon neutrality by 2030, moving from fossil fuels to sustainable green energy, and building a new growth economy that will provide jobs and innovation far into the future. Pittsburgh can lead the way, combining its world class education and tech resources with the powerful manufacturing and labor sector to create green industries. We need to ban fracking and restrict industrial emissions and move towards a cleaner future now. We can't afford to wait any longer. 

We also need urgent action on healthcare. Prices are out of control and only getting worse. Premiums rise twice as fast as wages and millions of Americans can't afford proper care. We need to work hard and push to make universal healthcare like Medicare for All a reality. We've seen in real-time what happens when our country is unprepared for a healthcare emergency. There is no time to sit idly by. 

Healthcare reform must truly be comprehensive. Comprehensive means national paid sick and family leave policies. Comprehensive means coverings reproductive rights and LGBTQ+ rights. Comprehensive means mental health and addiction treatment. Comprehensive means reducing pollution, improving nutrition in food deserts, and educating the public.</p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">Both sitting representatives and candidates for office hear many personal stories from the residents of their district. Is there a story that you’ve heard that you found particularly touching, memorable, or impactful?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">In order to represent the people of the district and to be a voice for the voiceless, I have spent time knocking on doors and meeting the people of every one of the district's 50+ municipalities. I have heard so many stories that ring true across the whole district. 

In Clairton, I met an older woman who came to the door with a respirator mask on. She had lived her whole life in the shadow of the Clairton coke works plant and was suffering from asthma. She could barely afford her medication and she couldn't afford to move out of the area. 

In Bridgeville, we came across a Planned Parenthood clinic that was closed most of the week and with limited hours on the days it was open because of the loss of funding due to the Trump administration. 

In Braddock, there was a server in a restaurant who used to be a business owner but lost her whole life savings battling cancer. 

These stories are extraordinary to me not because they are unusual but because they are all too common. Just like my brother's story, who lost his battle with opioid addiction. Like my sister's story, who works two jobs but can barely afford rent and food. These are the stories of the people of our city who are trying hard and who deserve a fair shake. These are the people that I am fighting for. </p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">What would be your top three priorities, if elected?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">•  Tax policies that promote economic diversity in the East Bronx and Northwest Queens, and encourage companies like Amazon to create good jobs for those who live here.     
•  School vouchers for charter and religious schools, as well as for specialized vocational schools, to improve K-12 education—for all students, including special needs students. 
•  Border and immigration control is not just national security, but also neighborhood security. Keep out violent gangs like MS-13 and Trinitarios, and stop the flood of opioids into our neighborhoods.</p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">What do you believe are the core responsibilities for someone elected to this office?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">To propose and support legislation that is in the best interest of the country as a whole, and of the community you represent, as well as to provide constituent services to the residents of your district. 

I firmly believe that instead of passing more laws, Congress should pass better laws -- laws that actually solve the problems they purport to address without creating unintended consequences that require still more laws to fix.</p>

					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What legacy would you like to leave?</p>

			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What is your favorite holiday? Why?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I love the Fourth of July even better than my birthday.

My parents immigrated to the United States from Egypt -- a nation that had recently transitioned from a monarchy to a Socialist military dictatorship under Nasser, with the Muslim Brotherhood trying to take advantage of the upheaval by working towards establishing a theocracy.

Independence Day has a special meaning for me, because my parents left everything and everyone they knew to ensure that their children would live free from the sectarian strife (to the point of genocide) common in other parts of the world; where women have the same legal rights, and opportunities for education and self-actualization as men; and where upward mobility is possible, regardless of your humble beginnings.

Being born in this country is the best gift they have ever given me; the best gift they could ever have given me.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What qualities does the U.S. House of Representatives possess that makes it unique as an institution?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">The House has the power of the purse -- the ability to tax and spend. This confers a unique responsibility to spend the nation's wealth wisely, and to root out fraud, waste and abuse. Taxpayers should not be treated as cash cows, and continually squeezed for increasingly greater shares of their incomes.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Do you believe that it's beneficial for representatives to have previous experience in government or politics?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">The House of Representatives should include people from all walks of life, rather than be a body comprised of millionaires and idealogues who do not represent the people who elected them.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">If you are not a current representative, are there certain committees that you would want to be a part of?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">•  Education and Labor
•  Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs
•  U.S. House Financial Services Subcommittee on Housing, Community Development and Insurance
•  Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs
•  Judiciary</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Do you believe that two years is the right term length for representatives?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">No, because you are always running for re-election. Four years is a more reasonable term -- for both the House and Senate, in my opinion.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What are your thoughts on term limits?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">There are arguments in favor of term limits, as well as against. Pros of term limits: Politicians don't ""go Washington"" and become out of touch with their constituents.  Also, fresh faces bring fresh perspectives and new ideas.Cons of term limits: Serving successive terms gives one experience, and the clout to move important legislation. And having a large number of inexperienced lawmakers in the legislative body increases the influence of lobbyists and activists.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Is there a particular representative, past or present, whom you want to model yourself after?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Daniel Patrick Moynihan. He represented NY in the Senate as a Democrat and served as an adviser to President Nixon, a Republican. He put country over partisanship, and was a towering intellect.</p>

				<p class=""survey-response"">Hello! 
 My name is Kevin Andrew Hale,  I'm an American citizen, a career salesman, and a hopeless romantic. I really didn't set out to be a politician, but our country has gone off the rails of liberty and freedom. I felt obligated to try and fix this mess, call me patriotic or just a man who sees and injustice and can't stand by and watch. I know, I could do a better job of following the US Constitution than both of the old parties are doing. 
 I've been on the front lines of Capitalism my entire career, knocked on my first door in 7th grade and won my first sales contest. (Jump Rope for Heart-Sponsorship drive, benefiting the American Heart Association) My skill set is transferable to every industry and certainly is needed now more than ever in American Politics. My job is to sell Freedom and Liberty as a solution back to Americans. It worked before and will work again, if we can just get government out of the way.
 My other job in this campaign is to Defeat the Apathy that has the majority of people not participating. 
Non-Voters out number the Voters in Congressional District 5.
If you want a third party, you can have it, just show up and vote to Give Congress Hale!
You will actually get stronger representation from me as a Libertarian, because once I take the oath of office, I will become the House Minority Whip! Imagine having a lobbyist on your side, in that position! Everyone is Libertarian! They just don't know it... YET! Peace, Love and Liberty!</p>
			</div>
						    <div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Please list below 3 key messages of your campaign. What are the main points you want voters to remember about your goals for your time in office?</p>
				<ul class=""key-messages"">
					<li>STOP THE ENDLESS WARS-We have almost been at war for 20 straight years- Let's try 20 years of Peace, </li>
					<li>RETURN TO CONSUMER DRIVEN MARKETS- (No Bailouts, subsidies, or special tax credits or loopholes for big corporations)</li>
					<li>END THE WAR ON DRUGS- Prohibition didn't work in the 1920's and 30's. Why do we think it does now? It only creates dangerous black markets. Stop the insanity of this policy and lets get addicts the help they need, not a jail cell.</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
							<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What areas of public policy are you personally passionate about?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Foreign Policy: My drive to do this is being fueled by the ENDLESS WARS.  None of which have been authorized by a \""Declaration of War\"", from Congress. A direct violation of the US Constitution. The cowards in congress have once again given away the enumerated powers to the president. Both parties have been guilty of this and \""WE THE PEOPLE\"" should have a vote in Congress, anytime we commit our brave Men and Women to battle. I will force Congress to either get us out of these entanglements or actually Declare them Wars, which will include an actual plan to win. I believe we are actually creating more terrorist with our intervention policy. I would vote to bring our troops home to protect American soil. We are not the worlds policemen and we certainly should not be the worlds mercenaries.   </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Is there a book, essay, film, or something else you would recommend to someone who wants to understand your political philosophy?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Ron Paul's book \""Liberty Defined\"" is a great starting point but I've been reading a lot over the last four years on Political Science and economics. 
F. A.Hayek's \""Road to Serfdom\""
Henry Hazlitt's \""Economics in One Lesson\""
Dr. Mary Ruwarts books \""Healing our World-The Compassion of Libertarianism\"" 
 \""Death by Regulation\""
Jon Meacham \""Thomas Jefferson- The Art of Power\"" 
are just a few of the titles and authors I've read!
And the US Constitution once a month! </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What qualities do you possess that you believe would make you a successful officeholder?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Honest to a fault, speaks up against injustices, and will hold ALL parties accountable to the US Constitution. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What legacy would you like to leave?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Defender of individual and economic freedom.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What was your very first job? How long did you have it?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">My First Job was working at the Car Wash on Buckner Blvd.  Took the Job when I was 15, with parents permission. I was a finisher in that I dried the cars/trucks once they came off the line. It wasn't long after that I got my DL and because I could drive a stick (still do) , I was the youngest driver to pull the cars/trucks off the line. (so many customers asked to see my drivers licence...lol) I got to drive a lot of cool cars including exotics! Drove CRAZY RAYS Lincoln, too! Go Cowboys! I saved my money and used it to restore my first car a 1966 Ford Mustang. Fixed the body rust and painted it the original spring time yellow. I later was trained to do details.  If I was able to sell a detail, I usually got to do the work and keep the tip.  I sold a lot of details the Summer I was trying to finish the restoration of the Mustang!  </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What is your favorite book? Why?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">This one is tough...so many! 
Zig Ziglar's \""See You At The Top\""
This book taught me a life lesson about determination, setting goals and most importantly taking action to accomplish them. I learned, anyone can accomplish anything as long as they set their mind to the task and work diligently towards that goal. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What qualities does the U.S. House of Representatives possess that makes it unique as an institution?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">At the federal level the US House is the grassroots pulse of the American public, being the broadest body it is the peoples closest ally to affecting change. Congress has 18 enumerated powers in the Constitution, unfortunately they have given away some of these powers to other branches of government or to private firms like the Federal Reserve. (Which needs to be audited)
I want Congress to grow a spine and take back its powers that are enumerated in the Constitution including the power to Declare War, and also have the integrity to pull back when it has overstepped its Constitutional authority! We should not ignore the 9th and 10th amendments, they are just as important as the Rest of the Bill of Rights.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Do you believe that it's beneficial for representatives to have previous experience in government or politics?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">No.... that is exactly the problem, as I see it! Career politicians have lost the pulse of \""We The People\"", because the Parties and Lobbyist that are influencing them are lining their campaign coffers with re-election money. (my incumbent opponent has half million dollars in his campaign account)
 We need regular everyday citizens to fill these rolls for a short period of time and return to private life.  If elected, I will limit my time in the U.S.House to a decade of service. (provided you the voters, decide to keep me every two years)
 If I can't get us out of the endless wars, and on the path to fiscally solid ground, with more economic and personal freedom in ten years, then I'm not the person who needs to be in that seat. I believe, I can do this job and will give every ounce of energy to doing it well! Give Congress Hale! </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Is there a particular representative, past or present, whom you want to model yourself after?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I am a big fan of Dr. Ron Paul, (aka Dr. NO)
 I hope that I earn the nick name of Rep. Hale NO! 
Freedom is a Solution, our founding fathers understood that our natural right to Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness came before government. We need to return to that philosophy. 
I'm also a huge fan of Thomas Jefferson.</p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">What would be your top three priorities, if elected?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Ending Citizens United and the culture of corruption in Washington are top priorities, which is why I'm proud to have led a coalition of over 100 House candidates and Members calling on Congress to make campaign finance reform the very first agenda item for the next Congress. The bill would reform the role of money in politics to ensure more transparency and accountability in our elections. We have to restore trust in our government and I will fight to protect the integrity of our Democracy.</p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">What areas of public policy are you personally passionate about?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">As a Consumer Protection Attorney, I have spent nearly twenty years fighting powerful interests and Wall Street banks on behalf of consumers and families. I am a national leader in consumer protection and has won big victories against financial institutions who cheat consumers.

Before the housing bubble burst, I was one of the first to sound the alarm about Wall Street's predatory practices targeting homeowners, winning recognition from the New York Times and many others.

In 2012, then California Attorney General Kamala Harris appointed me to be California's watchdog against the banks. The banks had promised to pay billions to homeowners they cheated, and Harris appointed me to make sure the banks followed through. My team and I held the banks' feet to the fire, securing over $18 billion and helping tens of thousands of families move forward with their lives.

As an advocate, I have sought reforms that help families get a fair shake in our economy. I have been a key player in the fight against abusive credit card fees and, in 2010, helped pass important federal credit card protections for families. I have written three books that document how Washington special interests skew our laws and cut off the legal rights of families who play by the rules.

In Congress, I will fight for Orange County families 100% of the time.I believe that Orange County deserves a Congresswoman who fights for families, and stands up to Donald Trump and powerful special interests including Wall Street, Big Pharma, and Big Oil.</p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">Who are you? Tell us about yourself in 300 words or less.</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Anna Paulina Luna is a veteran and unapologetic conservative who is ready to lead the next generation in the fight against radical socialism. She knows first-hand the power of the American Dream. It's her life story. Today that Dream is at risk. Extreme liberals push more government and less freedom, while career politicians - in both parties - are more beholden to special interests than their constituents. Anna took an oath to defend our country in the Air Force. She's now ready to take that oath to Washington. It's time for a representative who knows what it means to be built, not bought.</p>
			</div>
						    <div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Please list below 3 key messages of your campaign. What are the main points you want voters to remember about your goals for your time in office?</p>
				<ul class=""key-messages"">
					<li>The American Dream is at risk. We need to fight back against the Left's socialist agenda to save it. Freedom is a hallmark of American society and we must defend our constitutional rights from being infringed.</li>
					<li>For too long career politicians and lobbyists have dominated control of our political system. We need a ban on lobbying and term limits on members so people can stop profiting off our government. We have seen this have a national effect, not just with the ""SWAMP"" reputation of our current representative and DC, but its dangerous outcomes resulting in corporate lobbyists furthering and aiding the opioid crisis. Currently 1 person dies every 36 hours in Pinellas county. It is our responsibility to protect the people of this country and our district from these dangers. I intend on tackling this issue head on.</li>
					<li>Our community is coastal. Everything we do from our economy, to fishing, to tourism, to small business is tied into the health of our oceans. Instead of killing small business with an environmental tax, why are we not incentivizing these businesses to go green by giving them tax cuts? I plan on getting this done not just locally but nationally! I also and committed to ensuring that transportation and road-restoration is funded responsibly. The lifeline of a nation is its ability to transport goods. Being that we are one of the top fishing communities in the country, this is a top issue for me-ensuring that the district's economic needs are being met. </li>
				</ul>
			</div>
							<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What areas of public policy are you personally passionate about?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I am passionate about our veterans, the 2nd amendment, immigration, the fight against socialism, government corruption, and the economy.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Who do you look up to? Whose example would you like to follow, and why?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I have always had a lot of respect for Sarah Palin. Unfortunately, she was branded very poorly by the media and for a woman like myself in politics, it actually hurt every single one of us (whether Democrat or Republican). To have another strong woman like her branded as an \""airhead\"" and someone to not be taken seriously. Not only do I see eye-to-eye with her on many issues, but she never once let her career get in the way of being an amazing mother and wife. I respect her for that. I do believe that you can be a mother and still bring home the bacon.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Is there a book, essay, film, or something else you would recommend to someone who wants to understand your political philosophy?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Yes, there are a few.
Book: Discrimination and Disparities by Thomas Sowell
Book: The Art of War by Sun Tzu
Movie: The Patriot
</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What characteristics or principles are most important for an elected official?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">The notion that you cannot be \""bought,\"" a strong moral compass, a belief in a higher power, and a solid understanding of the constitution.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What qualities do you possess that you believe would make you a successful officeholder?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I am tenacious but polite and able to work across party lines for the unification of the country. I am a unifier and can find common ground with many people, but I will also never compromise my values. I'm ready to get American's across party lines talking again.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What do you believe are the core responsibilities for someone elected to this office?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Defend the Constitution of the United States of America even in the event that it goes against popular opinion. Represent and allow discussion with everyone in their district to include the ones that they may not typically agree with (whether that be conservative, liberal, etc.), and take an active role to better the community and the country.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What legacy would you like to leave?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I would like to pass immigration reform and reform the immigration system so that families do not have to choose between receiving benefits and being married to their loved one. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What is the first historical event that happened in your lifetime that you remember? How old were you at the time?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I remember Bill Clinton's testimony during his impeachment. I was 9 years old. I also remember my mom telling me to go to my room once he started talking about the charges. I am pretty sure she did that because she didn't want me to hear the context of what he was doing with Ms. Lewinsky.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What was your very first job? How long did you have it?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">My first job was a waitress at a café. I started working at 16 full-time, even while I was attending high school. I kept that job until I joined the military at 19.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What is something that has been a struggle in your life?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">For my entire childhood we were always struggling financially. It was not until I joined the military that I had a car for the first time, that I didn't have to worry about breaking down. I do not ever look at this as a negative though. It is through hard work that I was able to not only help myself but my family, and that is the American Dream that I will continue to fight for.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What qualities does the U.S. House of Representatives possess that makes it unique as an institution?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">The US House of Representatives is the greatest debate forum in the history of the world. For centuries our forefathers have engaged in ideological differences, over hours of hearings, all in the name of making our Country, and world, a better and safer place. There is no place else where we can all visit, watch, listen, learn and participate in our Republic at the same time. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Do you believe that it's beneficial for representatives to have previous experience in government or politics?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I don't believe it's necessary, if you look at our founding fathers and the first waves of elected officials, they weren't politicians. They were average citizens, farmers, herders, clerks who were doing their civic duty by representing their peers. You do not need to be a career politician to make a difference in our political climate.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What do you perceive to be the United States’ greatest challenges as a nation over the next decade?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Career politicians will continue to be the greatest challenge we face over the next decade. Look no further than my opponent Charlie Crist. He's been in politics so long, he changes his party registration whichever way the wind blows. North, South, East or West, if Charlie thinks it'll help him stay in power, accumulate wealth and abuse his position for personal gain, he will do it. We need term limits now.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">If you are not a current representative, are there certain committees that you would want to be a part of?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">• Armed Services
• Veterans Affairs
• Oversight and Reform
• Foreign Affairs
</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Do you believe that two years is the right term length for representatives?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Yes.  Two years allows voters to get an understanding of the true ideas of the person they elected holds. If they don't like them, vote them out. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What are your thoughts on term limits?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Every day that we don't have term limits we continue to facilitate the abuse of power and utilization of political office for personal gain. I will support any legislation to term limit myself, or other members of government. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">If you are not currently a member of your party’s leadership in the U.S. House of Representatives, would you be interested in joining the leadership? If so, in what role?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Speaker of the House. I want Pelosi's job. I'd be better at it.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Is there a particular representative, past or present, whom you want to model yourself after?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I have a lot of admiration for Matt Gaetz because of his honesty and grit. I also greatly respect Sarah Palin. I would be a hybrid of them.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Both sitting representatives and candidates for office hear many personal stories from the residents of their district. Is there a story that you’ve heard that you found particularly touching, memorable, or impactful?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Yes, I happened to be in Gulfport talking to some of the local business owners when I came across a homeless regular at one of the restaurants. He asked me to buy him food because he didn't have any money, of which I did agree. After talking to him, he was very open about the fact that 1) he was a felon and 2) he had a drinking problem. I myself grew up in a family that was not only impacted by addiction but also homelessness. In speaking with him, he told me that I was one of the first \""politicians\"" and businesswoman that he had ever had the opportunity to speak to. I think, especially now, people judge so many others by how they appear. This story stuck with me because a simple act of kindness goes a long way and you never know where people come from or the struggles that they face in their personal lives; away from what others may assume about them. To date, when I'm down in Gulfport I keep an eye out for him and speak to him if I can. Community outreach programs for the homeless need to be fostered and invested in. Especially for people that may not have any other opportunity. </p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">Who are you? Tell us about yourself in 300 words or less.</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Wife, mother, grandmother, conservative activist,  former business owner. 
When I was a single mother of six,  I started and finished a Bachelor's degree in less than three years and worked my way out of poverty.
In July of 2019, 132 brave Republicans voted AGAINST adding $2T to the federal debt.  On behalf of my grandchildren and your grandchildren, had I been in Congress,  I would have been #133 and I would have found 134, together, we would have found 135 and so forth. We cannot keep selling our grandchildrens' future! </p>

						    <div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Please list below 3 key messages of your campaign. What are the main points you want voters to remember about your goals for your time in office?</p>
				<ul class=""key-messages"">
					<li>End federal government over spending </li>
					<li>Abortion is the 21st century holocaust</li>
					<li>Reform legal immigration, including completing the wall on our southern border. </li>
				</ul>
			</div>
							<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What areas of public policy are you personally passionate about?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Budget and Debt, Abortion, LEGAL immigration</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Who do you look up to? Whose example would you like to follow, and why?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Harry Truman was the last regular American to be President  of the United States. I do not agree with many of the things he supported like federal-government-provided universal health care, he was a straight shooter, said what needed to be said and was fearless.
Gerald Ford comes close but he spent much of his life in politics. Truman's experience is more broad in the real world. 
Also, Truman won a term of his own. He did it by sheer will and grit. We need grit in today's Congress. It just does not exist on the conservative side of the equation. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Is there a book, essay, film, or something else you would recommend to someone who wants to understand your political philosophy?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">The Law by Bastiat, The to Serfdom by Hayak, Capitalism and Freedom by Milton Friedman, anything written by Mike Lee, Night by Elie Weisel, Man's Search for Meaning by Frankl, The Last Lion by William Manchester, nearly every film by Frank Capra. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What characteristics or principles are most important for an elected official?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">The top three are:
1. Fearless
2. Fearless
3. Fearless
We need more members of Congress who are willing to remember who they serve and as a result, they will be fearless in action and in word. 
</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What qualities do you possess that you believe would make you a successful officeholder?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Courage, grit, determination and focus. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What do you believe are the core responsibilities for someone elected to this office?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">1. Uphold the constitution
2. Be aware of every penny of tax money spent. 
3. Remember that you are a servant
4. Tell the truth to constituents even when you know they won't like it. 
</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What legacy would you like to leave?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I want my grandchildren to know that I tried to preserve their liberty by  getting into the arena, that I left it all on the field and that they are my greatest inspiration. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What is the first historical event that happened in your lifetime that you remember? How old were you at the time?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">The Kennedy assassination is a memory from elementary school but the first truly impactful event was the Challenger explosion because I was working in the aerospace industry at the time. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What was your very first job? How long did you have it?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Like millions of Americans, I flipped burgers for a year. 


</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What is your favorite book? Why?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Scriptures. Reading them reinforces who I am, where I fit in the grand scheme of things, reminds me the importance of love as a motivation. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">If you could be any fictional character, who would you want to be?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">J. Thomas Whitmore, Independence Day. Total badass.
Scarlett O'Hara. That b__ch got stuff done! NOTE: DO NOT agree with her methods. 
</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What was the last song that got stuck in your head?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Theme from Bridge on the River Kwai</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What is something that has been a struggle in your life?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Not only did I earn a Bachelor's Degree in just over two years, January 1983 -- August 1985, I did it as the single mother of six children, ages 2-12. 
Would not want to relive that experience but would not trade it for anything either. It brought out many qualities I didn't know I had previously. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What qualities does the U.S. House of Representatives possess that makes it unique as an institution?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">They have greater opportunity for collaborative work that responds directly to the American people. That is, if they want to do that. Today, we are so busy being partisan that principles no longer matter. Don't get me wrong. There are three issues on which I will not compromise (we cannot afford to add even one cent to the federal budget, nonprofits do not need federal help and we must reform LEGAL immigration). The land issue, and others, is ripe for compromise. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Do you believe that it's beneficial for representatives to have previous experience in government or politics?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Depends on the person. My experience is in the state and county Republican party. It has prepared me for the political climate and shown me the hard work that it takes to accomplish important things. 
</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What do you perceive to be the United States’ greatest challenges as a nation over the next decade?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Federal government spending. The nearly $24T in federal debt makes us vulnerable on many levels. I think our Founders are probably rolling in their graves over this issue. It does not matter what progress we make in other areas, if we cannot get the budget under control, we are leaving ourselves open to disaster as a result of the slightest hiccup in world markets or mother nature, </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">If you are not a current representative, are there certain committees that you would want to be a part of?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Budget, Interior, Small business, Ways &amp; Means, Oversight &amp; Government Reform</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Do you believe that two years is the right term length for representatives?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">A three-year term for House of Representatives would be a good change. Less time might be spent campaigning and more time working. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What are your thoughts on term limits?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">In the past couple of years, I've decided that since we have placed term limits on the President, we should place them on both houses of Congress. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Is there a particular representative, past or present, whom you want to model yourself after?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Although not a representative, Harry Truman's Senate work is a good model, Peter Rodino, as head of the Watergate investigation, was exemplary. In the present Congress, I will fit best with Mark Meadows, Thomas Masse, Jim Jordan and the Freedom Caucus.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Both sitting representatives and candidates for office hear many personal stories from the residents of their district. Is there a story that you’ve heard that you found particularly touching, memorable, or impactful?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">A rancher who is dealing with the U.S. Forest Service nearly daily. Nameless, faceless bureaucrats in D.C. do not have a clue about what it takes to farm and ranch. More than one story from people who have to deal with the federal  bureaucracy has effected me deeply.
Those stories reinforce for me how we need representatives who are unafraid to cut the bureaucracy. This can be done easily by cutting department budgets. States can then pick up responsibilities that they should have been carrying for decades! </p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">Who are you? Tell us about yourself in 300 words or less.</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">My name is Jeffrey A. Sites.  It was 34 years ago that I graduated from Lima Bath High School, a public high school.  I didn't know, on that day, where my life was taking me but what a journey it has been!
I have a great daughter, Emily who is 15 and has started driving.  She attends the same high school I did. Emily and I have had some bad times and some very good times together and I look forward to many more great times in the future. She is an awesome daughter!
My journey has taken me to Germany after I joined the Army in 1987.  I am proud to be called a veteran for serving in the peace-time Army.  I never fail to say ""thank you"" to veterans/combat veterans who have risked and sacrificed for this great nation.  
As a military spouse, we were stationed at SHAPE Belgium.  This is Strategic Headquarters Allied Powers Europe (NATO).  There, I had the great honor to meet our Allies and become friends in a short period of time that I was in Belgium.  Turks, British, French, Canadian, Germans, Americans and a host of other Allies, all standing together to keep the World free from nations such as Russia. I eventually landed back here in little bean town, Lima, my home. I am now an Assistant Manager of Logistics for an auto supplier in Findlay.  I have been there for 6 years.
The question candidates are always asked, ""why are you running?""  I give you this quote from Albert Einstein,

				<p class=""survey-response"">East Tennessean. Cat Mom. Clean Water Advocate. Candidate for Congress. That's my Twitter bio, and I think it sums me up. I served as the director of the Tennessee Clean Water Network for 14 years, where we took on polluters and forced them to take responsibility for their own mess. At TCWN, I advocated for major changes in government policy, testified in front of Congress, installed clean drinking water fountains at schools across Tennessee, and more. A proud granddaughter of immigrants and a product of public education, my Mom was a physical therapist and my Dad was a public school teacher. </p>

				<p class=""survey-response"">I got my first job when I turned 12 years old, cleaning stalls at the nearby stables. The stables were four miles from my home, so I rode my Schwinn Bantam, with streamers on the handlebar grips and a basket on the front, those four miles to earn $1 an hour shoveling manure. My bike was a fixed gear, so I had to walk the hills on the way, but I went three times a week. The lessons I learned on those hills have stuck with me ever since.</p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">What would be your top three priorities, if elected?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">1. Environmental policy - reforming our system to focus on green energy and solutions rather than relying heavily on fossil fuels and subsidizing them while they destroy our planet.
2. Healthcare - Medicare for all is a major, important step we can and should take as a nation to bring our healthcare system up to the standard of every other developed nation and stop bankrupting families by the millions.
3. Education - Fully funding public education, getting teachers livable salaries, shrinking class sizes to manageable levels, and making public universities affordable for everyone.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What areas of public policy are you personally passionate about?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">The number one public policy that I'm passionate about has to be healthcare. If not for how broken our healthcare system is, I wouldn't have seen my father so broken down that he could barely move, even while he worked to keep a roof over his family's head. If not for the fight that followed in trying to get him treatment without bankrupting myself, him, and everyone else we knew, I wouldn't have been motivated to step up and fight for that change myself. It was one of those things where you know this thing is broken, but you don't realize the immediacy of the issue until you're staring it in the face, and I don't want anyone else to have to face their hard-working family the way I did and see them so broken in spite of decades of breaking their back to support their spouses and children.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Who do you look up to? Whose example would you like to follow, and why?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I very much look up to my father. Watching and learning from him while growing up taught me how to be strong, but compassionate. To speak up when you see wrong, but still willing to listen to different opinions. I don't agree with him on a number of things, but if I'm half as good a man as my father, I'll consider myself a success.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Is there a book, essay, film, or something else you would recommend to someone who wants to understand your political philosophy?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I don't know about a specific book or essay, but there's a short quote that's been close to my heart throughout the political process, most often attributed to Marcus Aurelius:

""Live a good life. If there are gods and they are just, then they will not care how devout you have been, but will welcome you based on the virtues you have lived by. If there are gods, but unjust, then you should not want to worship them. If there are no gods, then you will be gone, but will have lived a noble life that will live on in the memories of your loved ones.""

I believe it represents well my political philosophy: to do not what is convenient, but what is right; and to say not whatever will make people happy immediately, but what people need to hear.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What characteristics or principles are most important for an elected official?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">There are a great many characteristics which are important for representatives, but to name the most important ones offhand: integrity, a mind for serving the people over yourself, and a willingness to do the right thing, even and especially when pressured otherwise.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What qualities do you possess that you believe would make you a successful officeholder?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I was always raised to stand up for others, especially people who are unable to stand up for themselves. Between that, having a solid moral center independent of public opinion, and a genuine desire to improve the lives of all my fellow Americans, I believe I have the most important qualities of a public representative well in hand.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What do you believe are the core responsibilities for someone elected to this office?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I believe the core responsibility of any member of Congress is to work towards improving the lives of everyone in their district through legislative solutions, but that's only one small facet of it. They also must serve as the public face of their district, and they're expected to be an anchor through tumultuous times, prepared to shoulder the weight of any and all failings they or their staff may have. They're expected to be answerable to each of their constituents, and should be available and answerable for each vote they take or avoid.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What legacy would you like to leave?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I would like to be remembered as someone who rose to meet an exceptional challenge at a time when our country faced its most divided time in decades, and who worked to heal that divide by bridging the gap between our different exploited communities and helping people obtain a mutual understanding of one another's unique situations.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What is the first historical event that happened in your lifetime that you remember? How old were you at the time?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">The first major historical event that I remember is the World Trade Center attack on 9/11. I was 13 years old, so obviously there were other memorable events in my life before it, but nothing that shook the foundation of American society the way 9/11 did. It was a level of evil that was difficult to comprehend for a teenager, but it was also so much more than that. In the days and weeks that followed I saw my country forget so many petty squabbles between individuals and, for the first time in my life, I believed that America at large was capable of being one cohesive country no matter how many subcultures we had. It was an inspiring moment of beauty from such an ugly act of hate, and I only wish we'd held on to that spirit longer than we did.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What was your very first job? How long did you have it?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">My very first job was a 2-week temp job. I was 15, and I had to dress up as a giant snowman mascot outside a Hallmark store for $10/hr. It was in Las Vegas, so while it was technically Winter, it didn't matter. It was 80  out every day, and it made for a pretty miserable experience standing in that suit in the sun.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What happened on your most awkward date?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Well, the most awkward thing that immediately comes to mind was someone I only went out with once. We met for dinner at a nice restaurant, and everything was going relatively well. We shared a lot in common, and seemed to be really hitting it off. But, as soon as dinner was over things got bumpy. We'd agreed to go to the movies, and had agreed on a movie that I can't even remember any more. But, when we got to the theater, she saw that one of the Twilight movies was playing, and demanded we change to that. I protested, but she was quite insistent. I ended up coming up with an excuse not to go to the movies, dropped her off back at home, and that was that. I don't know what made her so set on that movie specifically, but an attitude like that on a first date over a movie was a big enough red flag to me that I was ready to move on.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What is your favorite holiday? Why?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">My favorite holiday is New Year's. I really enjoy the theme of moving on and giving one another a fresh start, even if you've previously had disagreements or done someone wrong. I just think it's nice to have a holiday that's focused on the future rather than the past or even the now.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What is your favorite book? Why?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I very much like Flowers for Algernon. It's a sad story, but it very poignantly highlights how important it is to be sympathetic to people with circumstances which differ from our own, whether due to physiological and psychological circumstances, or simply a more or less fortunate life from birth. The focus, in particular, on how our treatment of people can directly affect their performance and their lives in drastic ways is very moving for me.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">If you could be any fictional character, who would you want to be?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I'd like to be Superman, the boy scout that always has the right answer immediately, but I suspect I'd have a lot more association to Bruce Wayne. Ready, willing and able to do the right thing, while still prepared to make the difficult decision when the occasion calls for it.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What is your favorite thing in your home or apartment? Why?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">It's not really a ""thing,"" but if I were to single out the best part of my home that isn't a human, I'd have to say my dog, Bear. I've had him since I rescued him while he was ~6 months old, and he's moved across the country with me twice. Poor guy is the only dog I've ever seen that hates car rides, they make him so nervous he throws up. He's been a trooper through the moves though, and I couldn't ask for a better canine companion. He always makes a rough day better when I get home and see how excited he is to see me.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What was the last song that got stuck in your head?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Istanbul (not Constantinople). It's just one of those songs that comes back to you once in a while and it hit me the other day, I spent a while just humming it to myself.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What is something that has been a struggle in your life?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Well, among many other things, finding a concrete direction. I grew up, like many young people today, in a world where my parents' careers wouldn't make for viable job paths. Between the cost of education to be prepared for them, the very low starting pay even for a qualified candidate, and simply not being invested in the same fields they were, it was easy to feel lost. It wasn't until I joined the military and became a public servant that I felt as though I was doing anything really meaningful, and it's the drive I gained from that service that makes me want to serve my nation in a different capacity.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What qualities does the U.S. House of Representatives possess that makes it unique as an institution?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">The US House of Representatives is unique as an institution because it serves in a somewhat hybrid federal and state capacity. That is: the Representatives therein are distinctly representing their districts on the federal level, but most Congressional districts are small enough that they still allow the Congressmen an opportunity to interact with many of their constituents directly when they're in their home districts. Despite the fact that many current Representatives don't opt to take the time to go around and meet with average constituents, instead opting to hold campaign events and photo ops when they come home for visits, I believe this is an important bridge that more Representatives should be working to cross.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Do you believe that it's beneficial for representatives to have previous experience in government or politics?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Yes and no. I believe it takes a mix of both old and new Representatives to build the best Congress we can. Having seasoned and experienced leaders is always important, especially in a governing body, but we should also be bringing fresh, young ideas to the table with new faces as well.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What do you perceive to be the United States’ greatest challenges as a nation over the next decade?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">There are two major, existential threats to America in today's world, one of which is also a global threat: the environmental crisis which threatens the entirety of human existence, and the division we've seen grow exponentially in recent years. Obviously the environmental issue cannot be solved by America alone, but we've done the world at large no favors by refusing to join a global environmental agreement, and we owe it to ourselves and future generations to step up to the plate and make some real progress towards a cleaner future before it's too late. The division issue, on the other hand, is entirely our own making. We repealed legislation preventing news outlets from pushing heavily biased coverage, and at the same time saw the rise of a brand new multimedia network that worked to legitimize extremely outlandish views and shift the range of what was ""normal"" in our political discourse. Until and unless we start holding both our media and our politicians liable for blatant lies and misdirection, we're not likely to see much progress made in reconnecting our country.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">If you are not a current representative, are there certain committees that you would want to be a part of?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I would like to be a part of the Ways and Means and Veterans' Affairs committees. Those are two major places where I believe I could make some substantial progress in improving American lives.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">If you are a current representative, why did you join your current committees?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">N/A</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Do you believe that two years is the right term length for representatives?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I'm actually conflicted on this. In a perfect world, I'd like to think the terms would be longer to minimize general political fatigue among the populace, but given the way Washington works - and has worked for quite some time - two years feels almost too long at the same time. All that taken into consideration, I'd say it's appropriate; it gives us a frequent opportunity to unseat people who don't represent us properly, while still allowing seated Representatives ample opportunity to make a difference and show their constituents what they can do.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What are your thoughts on term limits?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Term limits should be in place in all public offices. While there are some representatives who've served honorably for many terms, it's much more common that a person loses sight of why they're in office in the first place once they've been there for long enough. It would be a service to everyone if bringing in new representatives after 4-5 terms, maximum, were codified into law everywhere rather than just for the presidency.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What process do you favor for redistricting?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I believe the best redistricting process involves independent, nonpartisan districting committees.  Allowing any party control over the way district lines are drawn is inherently undemocratic, and is a practice which never should've started in the first place.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">If you are not currently a member of your party’s leadership in the U.S. House of Representatives, would you be interested in joining the leadership? If so, in what role?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Perhaps at some point, but I would much prefer to get my feet underneath me as a Representative for at least one term before crossing into any leadership roles.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Is there a particular representative, past or present, whom you want to model yourself after?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I'd like to think I take inspiration from many of our past Congressmen, but if I were to choose one, someone that stands out is Abraham Lincoln. Even before he was president, he was a Representative who worked hard to make progress happen. He believed in serving the people and compromising where necessary to make important gains. His overall views weren't perfect, and he's far behind the times by today's standards, but he had the courage to introduce new and progressive ideas coupled with the wisdom and patience to push for and enact them when it was most appropriate.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Both sitting representatives and candidates for office hear many personal stories from the residents of their district. Is there a story that you’ve heard that you found particularly touching, memorable, or impactful?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">As much as I hate to single out any one story among all the ones I hear, there's one that stands out to me when I read this question. It was at the end of a long day, after having been to two events already, when at the third a man approached me. He shared his story with me: he was a retired rail worker, and his pension was very likely to be cut because there was no legislation in place to prevent it. He contacted my incumbent - a man I'd seen at an earlier event, congratulating himself for all the great things he'd done for his constituents - and told him the same thing. When he did, they asked what would happen if his pension actually were to be cut, and he told them the proposed cuts would cause him to lose his house. They thanked him for his time, and then did nothing whatsoever to help. Worse, they continued to push anti-worker legislation that would encourage even more stories like this man's to happen right in my home district. The contrast between the two events, and hearing this man's story, really struck a chord with me. It was probably the worst day I've had on the campaign trail to date, but it's stories and people like him that remind me exactly why it's so important we get new representation.</p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">What would be your top three priorities, if elected?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Medicare For All
The Green New Deal
Criminal Justice Reform</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What areas of public policy are you personally passionate about?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">My life experiences have taught me that working class people don’t have real representation in Congress. So politicians who don’t represent our experiences and our interests create policies that negatively affect us. 

Based on these experiences, I am personally most passionate about Medicare for All, Criminal Justice Reform, and The Green New Deal. When I was pregnant, my health insurance company denied me life-saving medication. The hospital eventually negotiated on my behalf, saying they would have to hospitalize me at a much higher cost if the insurance denied the medicine. I know personally that we have to take profit out of healthcare insurance and insure absolutely everyone. 

I am a working-class person who commutes to work in a car in a context where minor traffic violations -- especially by people of color -- are targeted. As a person trying to make ends meet, I could not afford to pay my tickets, and with the lack of reliable public transit, I had no options but to drive to work on a suspended license.  When I was seven months pregnant, a judge sent me to jail for it. I have learned first-hand just how broken our criminal justice system is.

That experience also showed me that we need a public transportation system that can get everyone where they need to go in a quick, affordable, reliable way -- like what The Green New Deal could provide. Besides, none of our reforms are possible if we don’t tackle climate change. I feel the urgency because not only will I, as a 29-year old, continue to feel the consequences of climate change, my children will, too. I am passionate about The Green New Deal because it is an environmental framework that centers working-class, frontline, and marginalized communities with real solutions that acknowledge how enormous our climate change and economic inequality problems are.

We need people who get these experiences in Congress because we need to government to work for us, not the interests that profit from our struggles.</p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">Who do you look up to? Whose example would you like to follow, and why?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I am inspired by Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ilhan Omar. I admire them for their political courage and willingness to stand up, even to their own party’s leaders. This is the first time in my life I’ve seen members of Congress really speaking for people and for the planet. These women embody the spirit of representative government.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What characteristics or principles are most important for an elected official?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">An elected official, first and foremost, should have a deep belief in the inherent dignity of every person; they should believe that this dignity affords every person the right to be free from cruelty and exploitation. Second, an elected official should have an understanding of the ways in which America's economic and societal structures can be a source of indignity. They should have first-hand knowledge of how regular, working people are treated like they're less than human and prevented from exercising their full autonomy. And finally, elected officials should be able to translate their basic moral principles into public policy solutions, which remedy the societal injustices they've come to observe. 

Suggestion for a revision (although I really like the first one): Second, an elected official should take their duty to represent their constituency, and the American people at large, seriously. This means that elected officials must engage directly with movements and communities in order to advocate for policies that improve the lives of the many, not the few. This also means that an elected official cannot also be beholden to corporate lobbies and the funding they flood into our political system. Finally, an elected official must always have the courage to do what is right--especially if the action involves preserving the aforementioned dignity of all persons--even if it is not politically convenient.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What qualities do you possess that you believe would make you a successful officeholder?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I will be a successful office holder because of my ability to listen to and connect with the communities I represent. I am a life-long Maryland resident who has experienced the very real flaws in our system, and these experiences already give me credibility to speak to the district’s issues. I would continue to draw from these experiences and continue to regularly meet with community groups during my time in office. I know that we can only build a better world together.

I also possess the integrity that many current Congress members lack: my promise to not take money from corporate donors means that I will be able to represent the people instead of the businesses that I would otherwise be beholden to.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What do you believe are the core responsibilities for someone elected to this office?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I believe the core responsibility of someone elected to congress is to AMPLIFY the voices of her constituents. Beyond that, an elected official’s responsibility is to push through legislative change that directly addresses people’s concerns. In particular, I believe that elected officials have a duty to the most vulnerable and powerless in our society.

Due to the undemocratic nature of our current campaign finance laws, our elected officials suffer from a lack of accountability and concern for the working class people of their districts. That is why we see so many people, old and young, democrat, republican and independent, who have given up and chosen to disengage from the political process altogether.

As an elected official, my core responsibility would be to make sure people are heard and that their concerns are elevated to the national stage so that we can formulate the policy solutions that we need. It is important to me that my candidacy serves as a vehicle for empowering and amplifying the voices of those that have been left out or ignored.</p>

				<p class=""survey-response"">My favorite holidays are my children’s birthdays.</p>

					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What qualities does the U.S. House of Representatives possess that makes it unique as an institution?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">The U.S. House of Representatives is the most representative institution within the 3 branches of government. Elected House members have a 1-to-1 relationship to a specific geographic region, as opposed to an entire state. Each geographic region has unique challenges and strengths that need representation in a larger governing body, and the U.S. House of Representatives provides that representation.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Do you believe that it's beneficial for representatives to have previous experience in government or politics?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">It certainly can be beneficial, but I believe that the traditional interpretation of what makes someone “qualified” to hold public office is overly narrow. My qualifications to represent the people of Maryland’ 5th Congressional District primarily stem from the shared experiences I have with working-class people. I understand the struggles of everyday families to survive on less than a living wage because I’ve done it. I understand the toll that the healthcare crisis has on people who are uninsured or underinsured because I’ve been denied life-saving healthcare. I understand the scope of the housing crisis because I have family and friends who have been homeless for years – stuck on a permanently closed waiting list for housing assistance. Ultimately, while it can be beneficial to have previous experience in government or politics, it is more important for representatives to be in touch with the deepest concerns of their constituents.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What do you perceive to be the United States’ greatest challenges as a nation over the next decade?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">The greatest challenge facing the United States is the greatest challenge facing the entire world: climate change. Without courageous action, climate change will affect nearly every aspect of our lives. Rising sea levels will threaten millions of coastal homes; deadly wildfires will consume the American West every year. Maryland summers will come to feel like Mississippi. We must take aggressive steps in the near term to head off this threat. The only solution is a massive deployment of this country's economic and intellectual resources to make our energy sector entirely renewable, create millions of green union jobs, and to put frontline at the forefront. 

In the next decade, we must also take on, once and for all, the greed of the health industry. This means transitioning away from a system in which insurance and pharmaceutical executives call the shots. It means Medicare for All. 

Finally, we have to reform our criminal justice system, which currently extends the legacy of white supremacy and class hierarchy. The over-policing and disproportionate incarceration of people of color, working-class, and poor people have ravaged communities across the country, while for-profit prison executives get rich off of cheap and vulnerable prison labor. We must reform our criminal justice system to one of rehabilitation, not punishment for profit. Mass incarceration and the War on Drugs has been a failure, and it’s time for a new era in the justice system.</p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">If you are not a current representative, are there certain committees that you would want to be a part of?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">House Committee on Education and Labor

House Select Committee on the Climate Crisis
House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure

House Committee on Oversight</p>

					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What process do you favor for redistricting?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Over fifteen Republican representatives in Congress owe their seats to extreme partisan bias in the drawing of their respective district maps. Voters across the country made clear in the last midterm election that they favor citizen-led redistricting commissions. 

I support a constitutional amendment that would create a citizen-driven redistricting commission  to redraw both legislative and congressional districts.</p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">Who are you? Tell us about yourself in 300 words or less.</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I grew up in Atlanta, Ohio, a small town in Pickaway County about an hour south of Columbus. I graduated from Westfall High School where I played football, wrestled and ran track. After high school, I attended Ohio University where I got my Bachelor's in Political Science and Sociology. During my undergraduate time, I was part of Student Senate and helped start an online newspaper. Athens felt like home so when I decided to continue my education, Ohio University was the logical choice. During that time period I earned a Masters in Political Science, was the President of Graduate Student Senate, President of the Political Science Honors Fraternity, and Chaired the Board for the Center for Student Legal Services. 

After graduation, I moved to Franklin county where I graduated from law school, passed the bar exam, and now I am an attorney living in Northwest Columbus. During law school I was a representative for the Student Bar Association and Vice President of the Capital University Law School Democrats. During and after law school, I have been involved in local politics knocking doors for Zach Klein and Allison Russo (which helped flip an historically republican Ohio House District). I also managed a school board campaign in Hilliard. 

Since I have lived and worked all over this district, I know that each region of the district requires a unique touch in order to help the community succeed. I am Joel Newby, running for in the Ohio 15th and I'm your REAL hometown choice.</p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">Please list below 3 key messages of your campaign. What are the main points you want voters to remember about your goals for your time in office?</p>
				<ul class=""key-messages"">
					<li>Since I have lived and worked all over this district, I know that each region of the district requires a unique touch in order to help the community succeed.</li>
					<li>The people of this district can trust that I will properly represent them in Congress because I am one of them.</li>
					<li>My platform relies on my years of experience with the people of this district.</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
							<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What areas of public policy are you personally passionate about?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">The Ohio 15th Congressional District is a big district. To truly represent the district, the Representative must know that each region of the district requires a unique touch in order to help the community succeed. This is why my platform relies on my years of experience of living and working with the people of this district. I am passionate about improving life for farmers, quality and affordable higher education, protecting our environment, creating clean energy jobs, expanding and protecting healthcare, making housing more affordable, improving existing infrastructure, expanding broadband internet, expanding equality for all people, creating morally healthy immigration policy, and funding the State Department better because the more money the State Department receives, the safer the world will be. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Who do you look up to? Whose example would you like to follow, and why?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I look up to Senator Sherrod Brown. He is a great example of a great public servant, a great Ohioan, and a great American. His policies put workers first. He understands that government doesn't give handouts, it gives opportunities. Senator Brown protects America's economic interests and its economic future. He provides hope to us all. I would like to model my public service career after Senator Sherrod Brown.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What characteristics or principles are most important for an elected official?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">An elected official must be willing to make the tough decisions and then go home to their district to defend their decision. The Representative must always make the decision that benefits the district. They are elected to be smart enough to listen to their constituents and know how to vote to benefit their district the most. A Representative is useless and unworthy of the position if they duck the hard decisions. A Representative is worthless if they do not return to their districts to be held accountable for their decisions. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What legacy would you like to leave?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I would like to leave a legacy of building the midwest into an economic powerhouse. Ohio, including Southeast Ohio where poverty is at its highest, can become a leader in the 21st century economy. District 15 can have high paying, green jobs. It can get there, but it needs the leader it currently does not have. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What is your favorite book? Why?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln by Doris Kearns Goodwin. As an Ohioan, I enjoy how much Ohio and Ohioans played a role in Lincoln's governance. Learning about the people around Lincoln made him a real person for me instead of just a historical figure. But my favorite parts were learning about those who challenged Lincoln for the nomination and then worked with him later. They should also get credit for saving the union. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What was the last song that got stuck in your head?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Thunder by Imagine Dragons</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What do you perceive to be the United States’ greatest challenges as a nation over the next decade?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Climate change is the most urgent and defining challenge of our time. According to NASA, 18 of the 19 warmest years have occurred since 2000. In fact, the past five years have each now ranked among the five warmest on record. Ohio's farmers have felt the blunt of climate change with the extreme weather affecting their ability to get crops in the field. The elderly, very young, and those with health conditions are having their lives threatened. Schools have to close early due to extreme heat. We are leaving behind a profoundly damaged planet.

I am dedicated to tackling climate change and I will aggressively push for the United States to rejoin the Paris Climate Agreement. I favor legislation that commits the United State to reducing emissions nationwide as indicated by scientific research. I believe that America should be running entirely on clean energy before the mid-century mark. In fact, we should accelerate the transition to clean energy. This will help us meet our goals regarding carbon reduction. I reject the idea that fighting climate change means sacrificing the economy.

Another great challenge will be to protect the American worker and realize the dignity of work. I support helping American workers and businesses compete in the global economy by investing in green energy manufacturing, high-tech products, and clean energy cars. By committing our country to a complete transition to renewable energy, millions of new jobs will be created. I support committing this country to defending the American worker. While pushing for expanding the American economy into the international economy, we need to protect American jobs. We need to expand and protect American unions.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Do you believe that two years is the right term length for representatives?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Two years is the right term length for representatives. This allows for the country to metaphorically overthrow the government every two years. It is important that the whole House can be turned over. This can redirect the government and course correct the country. This allows the people to have control over their government. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Is there a particular representative, past or present, whom you want to model yourself after?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">When John Quincy Adams was in the House after his Presidency, he stood up for what he believed what was right. He fought against slavery when the fight wasn't popular. In fact, the House imposed the gag order about slavery partly because of John Quincy Adams. He eventually fought to repeal the gag order. His constituents trusted him to make the right decision. I hope my would-be constituents will trust that I will always do what is right, even when they disagree with my decision. Representatives are elected to make the tough decisions, so they should not duck those tough decisions. </p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">Who are you? Tell us about yourself in 300 words or less.</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Monica De La Cruz-Hernandez comes from humble beginnings. Her grandmother immigrated to the U.S. as a child to flee political injustice in Mexico. Monica's grandfather was a first-generation American, &amp; proudly served in the U.S. Navy. Monica's mother singlehandedly raised her &amp; her brother. Growing up, Monica's family built strong foundations of perseverance, respect, &amp; courage that motivated her to be involved in her community. Living on the border &amp; attending public schools, she saw firsthand the effects of a broken immigration system &amp; failed government policies.

Monica attended UTSA, where she worked to put herself through college. While there, she became a UTSA ambassador &amp; vice president of her business fraternity.  Monica applied for an internship with Turner Entertainment &amp; was selected out of 300 applicants. She went on to work for TNT in Atlanta.  Monica wanted to return to her Rio Grande Valley roots where she eventually opened her own insurance agency. Monica became the first female agent in the Rio Grande Valley to earn the prestigious  President's Club award. 

Monica's tenacity is shaped by a history of resilient, independent women &amp; men who proudly served their country. Her story is one of struggle &amp; opportunity.  She's used her life experience to fuel her desire to achieve the American Dream. Today, Monica &amp; her husband are proud small business owners.  They live in Edinburg with their three children &amp; worship at St John's Episcopal Church.</p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">Please list below 3 key messages of your campaign. What are the main points you want voters to remember about your goals for your time in office?</p>
				<ul class=""key-messages"">
					<li>Immigration &amp; U.S. Border Security - We need reform to keep people from coming in the wrong way, and a strong border to protect our American citizens. Listening to the expertise of the Border Patrol is key.</li>
					<li>Precious Life - Human life begins at conception.</li>

							<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What areas of public policy are you personally passionate about?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I believe in the traditional values of faith, family, and freedom that have made our state and nation strong. 

I believe we protect the sanctity of marriage, as families are strongest when they stay together.

I believe we must remove government imposed burdens that stifle small business and cost jobs. Small businesses should have fewer taxes and less government interference.

I believe we must secure our border and finish the wall so that we can stem the tide of illegal immigration and protect American citizens and American jobs. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Who do you look up to? Whose example would you like to follow, and why?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I have had strong role models throughout my life. My grandmother immigrated to the United States as a child to flee political injustice in Mexico. My grandfather was a first-generation American, and proudly served in the U.S. Navy, and my mother, Norma, singlehandedly raised me and my brother. My grandparents and mother taught me the value of hardwork, determination, and self-reliance. They taught me the importance of perseverance, respect, and courage and the hope of achieving the American dream. They taught me that I must always give back to the community, state, and nation, that have given me and my family so much and they instilled in me a deep and abiding faith-faith in God, faith in my fellow man, and the faith that, with hardwork and preserverance, I could accomplish anything that I set my heart and mind upon. I carry my family's values and love of country deep inside me. They are the values that define who am I am and what I stand for, and they are the values that I will carry with me to our nation's capital as the next Member of Congress from the 15th District of Texas.  </p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">Who are you? Tell us about yourself in 300 words or less.</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Anna Paulina Luna is a veteran and unapologetic conservative who is ready to lead the next generation in the fight against radical socialism. She knows first-hand the power of the American Dream. It's her life story. Today that Dream is at risk. Extreme liberals push more government and less freedom, while career politicians - in both parties - are more beholden to special interests than their constituents. Anna took an oath to defend our country in the Air Force. She's now ready to take that oath to Washington. It's time for a representative who knows what it means to be built, not bought.</p>
			</div>
						    <div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Please list below 3 key messages of your campaign. What are the main points you want voters to remember about your goals for your time in office?</p>
				<ul class=""key-messages"">
					<li>The American Dream is at risk. We need to fight back against the Left's socialist agenda to save it. Freedom is a hallmark of American society and we must defend our constitutional rights from being infringed.</li>
					<li>For too long career politicians and lobbyists have dominated control of our political system. We need a ban on lobbying and term limits on members so people can stop profiting off our government. We have seen this have a national effect, not just with the ""SWAMP"" reputation of our current representative and DC, but its dangerous outcomes resulting in corporate lobbyists furthering and aiding the opioid crisis. Currently 1 person dies every 36 hours in Pinellas county. It is our responsibility to protect the people of this country and our district from these dangers. I intend on tackling this issue head on.</li>
					<li>Our community is coastal. Everything we do from our economy, to fishing, to tourism, to small business is tied into the health of our oceans. Instead of killing small business with an environmental tax, why are we not incentivizing these businesses to go green by giving them tax cuts? I plan on getting this done not just locally but nationally! I also and committed to ensuring that transportation and road-restoration is funded responsibly. The lifeline of a nation is its ability to transport goods. Being that we are one of the top fishing communities in the country, this is a top issue for me-ensuring that the district's economic needs are being met. </li>
				</ul>
			</div>
							<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What areas of public policy are you personally passionate about?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I am passionate about our veterans, the 2nd amendment, immigration, the fight against socialism, government corruption, and the economy.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Who do you look up to? Whose example would you like to follow, and why?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I have always had a lot of respect for Sarah Palin. Unfortunately, she was branded very poorly by the media and for a woman like myself in politics, it actually hurt every single one of us (whether Democrat or Republican). To have another strong woman like her branded as an \""airhead\"" and someone to not be taken seriously. Not only do I see eye-to-eye with her on many issues, but she never once let her career get in the way of being an amazing mother and wife. I respect her for that. I do believe that you can be a mother and still bring home the bacon.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Is there a book, essay, film, or something else you would recommend to someone who wants to understand your political philosophy?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Yes, there are a few.
Book: Discrimination and Disparities by Thomas Sowell
Book: The Art of War by Sun Tzu
Movie: The Patriot
</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What characteristics or principles are most important for an elected official?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">The notion that you cannot be \""bought,\"" a strong moral compass, a belief in a higher power, and a solid understanding of the constitution.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What qualities do you possess that you believe would make you a successful officeholder?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I am tenacious but polite and able to work across party lines for the unification of the country. I am a unifier and can find common ground with many people, but I will also never compromise my values. I'm ready to get American's across party lines talking again.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What do you believe are the core responsibilities for someone elected to this office?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Defend the Constitution of the United States of America even in the event that it goes against popular opinion. Represent and allow discussion with everyone in their district to include the ones that they may not typically agree with (whether that be conservative, liberal, etc.), and take an active role to better the community and the country.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What legacy would you like to leave?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I would like to pass immigration reform and reform the immigration system so that families do not have to choose between receiving benefits and being married to their loved one. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What is the first historical event that happened in your lifetime that you remember? How old were you at the time?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I remember Bill Clinton's testimony during his impeachment. I was 9 years old. I also remember my mom telling me to go to my room once he started talking about the charges. I am pretty sure she did that because she didn't want me to hear the context of what he was doing with Ms. Lewinsky.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What was your very first job? How long did you have it?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">My first job was a waitress at a café. I started working at 16 full-time, even while I was attending high school. I kept that job until I joined the military at 19.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What is something that has been a struggle in your life?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">For my entire childhood we were always struggling financially. It was not until I joined the military that I had a car for the first time, that I didn't have to worry about breaking down. I do not ever look at this as a negative though. It is through hard work that I was able to not only help myself but my family, and that is the American Dream that I will continue to fight for.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What qualities does the U.S. House of Representatives possess that makes it unique as an institution?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">The US House of Representatives is the greatest debate forum in the history of the world. For centuries our forefathers have engaged in ideological differences, over hours of hearings, all in the name of making our Country, and world, a better and safer place. There is no place else where we can all visit, watch, listen, learn and participate in our Republic at the same time. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Do you believe that it's beneficial for representatives to have previous experience in government or politics?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I don't believe it's necessary, if you look at our founding fathers and the first waves of elected officials, they weren't politicians. They were average citizens, farmers, herders, clerks who were doing their civic duty by representing their peers. You do not need to be a career politician to make a difference in our political climate.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What do you perceive to be the United States’ greatest challenges as a nation over the next decade?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Career politicians will continue to be the greatest challenge we face over the next decade. Look no further than my opponent Charlie Crist. He's been in politics so long, he changes his party registration whichever way the wind blows. North, South, East or West, if Charlie thinks it'll help him stay in power, accumulate wealth and abuse his position for personal gain, he will do it. We need term limits now.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">If you are not a current representative, are there certain committees that you would want to be a part of?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">• Armed Services
• Veterans Affairs
• Oversight and Reform
• Foreign Affairs
</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Do you believe that two years is the right term length for representatives?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Yes.  Two years allows voters to get an understanding of the true ideas of the person they elected holds. If they don't like them, vote them out. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What are your thoughts on term limits?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Every day that we don't have term limits we continue to facilitate the abuse of power and utilization of political office for personal gain. I will support any legislation to term limit myself, or other members of government. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">If you are not currently a member of your party’s leadership in the U.S. House of Representatives, would you be interested in joining the leadership? If so, in what role?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Speaker of the House. I want Pelosi's job. I'd be better at it.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Is there a particular representative, past or present, whom you want to model yourself after?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I have a lot of admiration for Matt Gaetz because of his honesty and grit. I also greatly respect Sarah Palin. I would be a hybrid of them.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Both sitting representatives and candidates for office hear many personal stories from the residents of their district. Is there a story that you’ve heard that you found particularly touching, memorable, or impactful?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Yes, I happened to be in Gulfport talking to some of the local business owners when I came across a homeless regular at one of the restaurants. He asked me to buy him food because he didn't have any money, of which I did agree. After talking to him, he was very open about the fact that 1) he was a felon and 2) he had a drinking problem. I myself grew up in a family that was not only impacted by addiction but also homelessness. In speaking with him, he told me that I was one of the first \""politicians\"" and businesswoman that he had ever had the opportunity to speak to. I think, especially now, people judge so many others by how they appear. This story stuck with me because a simple act of kindness goes a long way and you never know where people come from or the struggles that they face in their personal lives; away from what others may assume about them. To date, when I'm down in Gulfport I keep an eye out for him and speak to him if I can. Community outreach programs for the homeless need to be fostered and invested in. Especially for people that may not have any other opportunity. </p>

				</ul>
			</div>
							<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What areas of public policy are you personally passionate about?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Health care. Obamacare has been devastating for many in Idaho, precipitating the loss of insurance plans and doctors, and causing premiums to skyrocket. Obamacare must be repealed. Idaho deserve healthcare freedom. We must introduce free market principles that empower patients by giving more choices, at lower costs. Ray favors tax-free health savings accounts, portable insurance policies, and removing artificial state barriers that drive costs up.</p>

					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Is there a book, essay, film, or something else you would recommend to someone who wants to understand your political philosophy?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">My political philosophy is really a combination of things read, viewed, and heard. I am very eclectic, I do not think any one thing can capture my philosophy.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What characteristics or principles are most important for an elected official?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Congruence-a genuineness and being authentic. No one is perfect, we all have faults.

			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What do you believe are the core responsibilities for someone elected to this office?</p>

					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What do you perceive to be the United States’ greatest challenges as a nation over the next decade?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Our country has to focus on balancing a budget, being good stewards of our nation. We have to live within out means and realize the purpose of a budget is long term sustainability as a nation. Climate change is real, we are in a position today to help reverse the damage. Once we take action we can start moving forward on finding solutions if we all work together. Mental health in our youth, veterans, and senior citizens are extremely pressing. The number of mental health related incidents are increasing, limited resources, and limit personnel. The stigma of mental health is costing more lives today than any other time in our history.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What qualities does the U.S. Senate possess that makes it unique as an institution?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Strength, our Senate has stood the test of time. The Senate is an institution is established. We know it can work. We know that if our leadership faced the facts they would know too that currently our government is being attacked within, this attack is more dangerously than any foreign power. We have to clean house and return to the basics. Look at the opportunity to grow, develop, and strengthen the country through cooperative relationships.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Do you believe that it’s beneficial for senators to have previous experience in government or politics?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I do not believe that it is beneficial in the since that an American without experience should be dismissed. When our country was founded our government consisted of farmers, small business leaders, and yes politicians. I think that the diversity is important, I feel that we all govern throughout our life and have experiences that are relevant. If we get back to the basics and really center on the job at hand, past governmental experiences would not matter and we would probably get more done.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What do you think of the filibuster?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I feel strongly we have a right to take up a cause, that being said, the cause has to justify the means.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What criteria would you apply when deciding whether to confirm presidential appointees?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I feel that the whole picture should be presented. I say that meaning, out past cannot define us, are adult actions should be the focal point of discussion. We often do not change to much, we might be better at hiding things, but the truth will come out. I think everyone should be given the benefit of the doubt, and let the evidence of their character define the person.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Do you believe it’s beneficial to build relationships with other senators?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Strong relationships are the fundamental key to growth, understanding and open communication that leads to compromise and action.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">If you are not a current senator, are there certain committees that you would want to be a part of?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I would like to work on committees that engage change. I feel that I lean more toward education, farming,military, foreign and domestic affairs committees. My first committee choice would be the Health, Education, Labor, and Pension Committee. This committee includes areas that I am passionate about like mental health care in schools. Second committee choice would be Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry our of default of coming from a rural community and state where agriculture is in fabric of many lives in Kentucky. Third committee choice would be Foreign Affairs, I feel that relationships are very important, building strong alliances will only strengthen our position as a world power. Fourth would be the Veterans or Homeland Security and Government Affairs. I feel that security is very important and those that provide us security should be allocated resources.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">If you are not currently a member of your party’s leadership in the U.S. Senate, would you be interested in joining the leadership? If so, in what role?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I would take a leadership role in US Senate, I think that most candidate that enter the race to be a lead. Not all can be a leader and not all leaders can lead. I think that leadership is about building and providing opportunities to create leaders.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Is there a particular senator, past or present, whom you want to model yourself after?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I honor and respect W. Ford from Kentucky. I had the honor and pleasure to meet and speak to him. He inspired me to make change in my own life. I have also admired T.

				<p class=""survey-question"">Who are you? Tell us about yourself in 300 words or less.</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Born and raised in Northeast Ohio, I am a firm believer that you won't find better people anywhere in this country. Hard workers, strong families and down to earth good people. These are the people that make District 11 and our country great but our potential is being held back by a government that wants to control every aspect of our lives. That is why I am joining this fight. 
I am 24 years old. I graduated from the University of Findlay with $100,000 in student loans and I currently live in a small duplex in Cleveland with 2 roommates. A millennial with copious amounts of debt who has to find ways to pay the rent. Stop me if you've heard this story before. The media and the Democrat Party would have you believe that everyone like me wants the government to forgive my loans and pay for my housing with taxpayer money. They would be wrong. I, like so many others, simply want the government out of my life. 
After graduation, I knew I wanted my life to be measured in impact, not in dollars and cents. In 2018 I founded my non-profit organization, Diamonds in the Rough. Having played baseball my entire life through little league, high school, collegiate and professionally, I know what a huge positive impact that sports can have on one's life. I also realized that so many communities lacked any recreational opportunity. Diamonds in the Rough is dedicated to transforming neglected baseball fields, in underprivileged communities, into state of the art ballparks. </p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">Please list below 3 key messages of your campaign. What are the main points you want voters to remember about your goals for your time in office?</p>
				<ul class=""key-messages"">
					<li>My campaign will be centered on The Great American Idea that each individual should dictate their own life and destiny. This idea has led to the most prosperous and free society that the world has ever seen. I believe that a mother should decide where her child goes to school, not the federal government. I believe a senior citizen should make healthcare decisions that are best for them, not the federal government. I believe that YOU, the individual, should have control over your own life.</li>
					<li>I want every individual to know that they can provide an infinitely better life for themselves than the federal government ever could.</li>
					<li>I do not care if you are a Democrat, Independent, Republican or Libertarian, I will always fight for your right to live free and make your own decisions. America is at a crossroads, seemingly more divided  than ever. If we are to move forward as a nation we must learn to love and respect one another, regardless of our political disagreements. Please join me as I work to heal this country and fight for the great people of Ohio's 11th district.</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
							<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What areas of public policy are you personally passionate about?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Education:
There is no reason that a child born in East Cleveland should have less access to quality education than a child born in Beachwood. For decades, politicians have continued to pour money into failing public schools and programs all while attempting to limit the choices that parents have over their children's education. Added to the fact that the government has forced a one-size-fits-all standardized approach to teaching and learning, much of our education system has been broken for some time. The solution is putting more power in the hands of parents and children. This means continuing to advocate for greater school choice, proper funding of charter schools that out perform traditional public schools and equipping our children with life skills rather than ""teaching to the test.""

Healthcare: 
Healthcare costs are out of control. No one should have to go broke to get the quality care that they need. However, we must understand that more government control over your healthcare is not the answer. The healthcare industry is the most heavily regulated and subsidized industry in the country and over the past 20 years healthcare costs have increased more than any other industry. Yet, we are led to believe that if we just give more control to the federal government, our costs will go down. Not only has this been a disaster in countries like Venezuela, but ideas like medicare for all and universal healthcare will bankrupt the industry and destroy our quality of care.</p>

Human Trafficking: Houston is considered a hub of human trafficking, and it's a severe problem we need to solve NOW.

Immigration: Without national security, nothing else matters. Either we have a nation or we don't.

Infrastructure: It's the key to economic growth within District 18.

2nd Ammendment: We all deserve to know our government is doing its job to keep guns out of the hands of criminals, illegals, those on the no-fly list, and the mentally ill.</p>

							<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What areas of public policy are you personally passionate about?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">• Corporations should not be allowed to buy politicians. Until we can overturn Citizens United, we need more transparency in government.

• Health care needs to be considered a human right. Everyone should be able to receive high quality health care from the doctors they choose to see without worrying that they will go broke in the process. That is why I support Medicare for All.

• We are a coastal district and our survival is at stake. I support the Green New Deal and strongly believe we must enact climate protections including a shift to 100% renewable energy in the next ten years, eliminate carbon emissions and dependence on fossil fuel, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. A Green New Deal gives America the opportunity to be an international leader in transitioning to a green economy. For this to happen, we need to first eliminate anti-environment lobbying. 

• I support Common Sense Gun Safety Laws to ensure our families are safe from those who intend to do us harm. That includes expanding background checks, closing gun show loopholes, banning assault weapons and high capacity magazines, enacting a federal red flag law and implementing a national licensing program.

• The choices around women's reproductive rights should be left up to women, and access to health care shouldn't be limited by income. I adamantly support the repeal of the Hyde Amendment and pledge to fight any attack on Roe v Wade.

• I support protections for DACA and a path to citizenship for</p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">What do you perceive to be the United States’ greatest challenges as a nation over the next decade?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">The greatest challenges the United States faces over the next decade involve us putting people back at the center of our policies. Our government and elected officials have continually doubled down on a broken system that repeatedly prioritizes corporate profits over the lives and wellbeing of working class Americans. Reversing this trend is a priority.

We need to ensure that we are treating equity and equality as human rights and that predatory industries aren't allowed to target and profit off of others' misfortune. That means single-payer healthcare so no one dies because they can't afford to see a doctor or receive prescriptions or treatment. It means free public college so everyone can get the education they need without starting their careers in generational debt. It means putting an end to homelessness, mass incarcerations and our forever wars. It also means saving our planet from our climate crisis. All of this can only be accomplished by removing the influence of corporate money in politics. </p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">What would be your top three priorities, if elected?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Establishing Ranked Choice Voting to break the two party system
Single Payer Medicare for All
Abolish the NSA, CIA, ICE, and the TSA</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What areas of public policy are you personally passionate about?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I hate having to choose between two bad candidates because one is a 'lesser' evil. Politics is not two dimensional. A choice between two candidates cannot represent everyone in a meaningful way. It's no coincidence that half of Americans don't vote. Why should they? They don't have any good choices. If they had their choice of 5 or 6 candidates they might actually like one or two of them.

People in this country are dying because they cannot afford their insulin. It costs $3 to make a vial of it and it is sold for hundreds of dollars. There is nothing more disgusting than letting people die to make more money. Revoke patents, directly produce insulin and sell it at cost, and or negotiate down the drug prices with a single payer system, any or all of these would tank the price of insulin and make it so no one dies from lack of insulin in America again. The problem is not just insulin however, other life saving drugs cost far too much for the sake of corporate profit. Its not a question of if we can lower drug prices its a question of whether we prioritize profits or human life. I choose human life.

I hate it when government agencies break the law as a matter of policy. The NSA, CIA, and ICE are all guilty of this. The NSA illegally spies on Americans and puts back doors in our software. The CIA destroys democracies around the world and earns us the world's hate. ICE runs concentration camps with horrible conditions. Abolish all three criminal agencies. The TSA should also be abolished, partly because it is an invasion of privacy and partly because it is an incompetent waste of 8 billion dollars a year.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What is the first historical event that happened in your lifetime that you remember? How old were you at the time?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I was six years old when 9/11 happened. I saw our country fall into a paranoid security state without knowing what any of it meant at the time. Our post 9/11 security measures haven't helped protect us they've only whittled down at our freedom. The PATRIOT act was one such measure. It is unconstitutional and should be abolished.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What are your thoughts on term limits?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Term limits are tempting at first glance as a way to clear out the corruption from congress. Unfortunately in our current system, term limits would just give more power to lobbyists to control inexperienced congressmen. I think getting money out of politics is a much better way of clearing out the garbage.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What process do you favor for redistricting?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Ideally redistricting should be accompanied by ranked choice voting. Three districts should be combined into one district with three representatives. This makes gerrymandering much harder and provides better representation to everyone.</p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">Who are you? Tell us about yourself in 300 words or less.</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Grassroots climate activist, industrial and environmental consultant, Root Routledge, PhD, lives in Durango, Colorado. 

Root's low-budget ""climate insurgency"" campaign is focused on four strategic issues that are crucial to a viable future for our country and our planet: Healthy Democracy, Healthy Population, Healthy Environment, and Healthy Economy. These are ""gateway"" issues that represent strategic threats to a viable future if not addressed with the scope and urgency of the problems in a comprehensive way. The climate emergency must have central focus.

Root supports Bernie Sanders for President and Colorado progressive candidate Andrew Romanoff for U.S. Senate. Root is for Medicare For All, Green New Deal, price on carbon, a just economy for all with living wages, free public education through college, and elimination of student education debt. In particular, as a Western Colorado candidate, he is concerned with rural healthcare access issues, water resource conservation, and climate impacts on agriculture.

Root is a scientifically educated systems engineer and experienced systems problem-solver, who has worked for the US Forest Service, Weyerhaeuser R&amp;D, and Hewlett Packard, before becoming a consultant in industrial and environmental data analytics. He has a deep understanding of the science of climate stability, climate impacts, and climate policy.

Root, age 73, has 3 grandchildren and is passionate about fighting for a viable future with a lead on climate.</p>

			</div>
							<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What areas of public policy are you personally passionate about?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Healthy Environment - Climate emergency, climate justice, effective climate policy. Distributed renewal energy; energy conservation; revamping our transportation sector.

Healthy Population - Medicare For All, expanded and improved, comprehensive universal single payer healthcare. Everyone in; no one out. Progressive financing: de-concentrates elite capital (the 1%); addresses income inequality (99%). 

Healthy Democracy - HR1 For the People Act. Fixing the corruption of our democracy; election justice and integrity; money out of politics, public financing and campaign finance transparency. Overturn the disastrous Supreme Court \""Citizens United\"" decision. Restore VRA; voter access \""one-person; one-vote\"". Secure our election system; incorporate election quality assurance measures.

Healthy Economy - Public bank for public projects; economy that works for everyone; living wages; thriving local economies that produce good paying jobs and entrepreneurial opportunities.

			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Who do you look up to? Whose example would you like to follow, and why?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Senator Bernie Sanders. I was elected a 2016 National Presidential Delegate for Bernie Sanders (one of 4 from Colorado's 3rd District) and fought for Bernie and our democracy at the Philadelphia Democratic National Convention. Bernie Sanders has been fighting for ordinary people for decades, since the early 1960s. His positions are consistent throughout his political career, fighting for a better America with concerns for ordinary working families, the poor, the environment, healthcare, public education and so many other good things. He is the strongest union supporter in the entire U.S. Congress.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is the most amazing political phenomenon in recent history. She has taken on the entrenched high-ranking Democratic establishment incumbent, and beaten him. She then struck her own path in Congress, rejecting the \""tow-the-line\"" establishment power structure; and has fought for ordinary people, our environment and climate, our health, and our future. She and her young new colleagues have introduced amazing legislation, especially the House Resolution directing the government to take an integrated system-wide perspective and response to our climate crisis, with a just transformation (climate justice) to a viable future - HRes 109 - The Green New Deal. She is a tough working-class girl from the Bronx, who is a fighter and a visionary. As a freshman representative, I would seek out her advice and mentoring to quickly get up to speed as a new Congress member. In fact, I'd want an office near her and the \""Squad\"".

Amy Goodman, who co-founded \""Democracy Now!\"" in 1996,  is the most respected journalist, investigator, and news reporter of today. She has received multiple awards, and maintains the dignity, respect, and independence for her prominent and growing news program, DemocracyNow.org, that we all now depend on for truthful news, analysis and insights. A fearless and courageous journalist for decades, Amy is definitely one of my heroes.</p>

It forms the basis of my campaign platform and is titled: \""Strategic Vision for a Viable American Future - A moral story of truth for our time\"". That work, and the many references I've drawn from, is most representative of my political philosophy?

				<p class=""survey-question"">What legacy would you like to leave?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Turn the corner on our global climate crisis; set the planet on a course toward some semblance of stable climate for our children, grandchildren and the generations that follow them. Do it in  a way that improves people's lives in the present, with universal healthcare, and an economy that works for everyone.</p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">What is the first historical event that happened in your lifetime that you remember? How old were you at the time?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">As a 1st grade student in Canada, (1952/53, age 7), there was a big school-field sized celebration of the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II, at which we were all given a commemorative medallion. Family moved to the U.S. in fall of 1953, as I was going into the 2nd grade.

As a 6-grader science nerd kid (1958/59, age 12) in Seattle, the big thing that happened was the launch of Sputnik. We had telescopes, radios and electronics and were making our own rockets as our country was deciding how to respond.

Then the Cuban Missile Crisis (October, 1962, age 16). I knew kids who quit high school and joined the Army to fight our enemies because of the perceived threat and emotional response of many.

The next has to be the assassination of President John F Kennedy, (November, 1963, age 17). I was in band practice when the announcement came over the loudspeaker. All students were in horror and crying.

After that, the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution (August 1964, age 17), throwing our country into the Vietnam War. People I knew quit college to join the military; or were getting drafted. The war heated up and raged on; I graduated from college in 1968, right into this raging war; would be drafted, but couldn't be an officer as a non-citizen. So, I got my U.S. Citizenship in 1968, and joined the U.S. Air Force, fighting this war from 1968 to 1972.

Next big historical event was our involvement in the Middle East, attacking Iraq (January 1991, age 44). Then 9-11 attack (September 11, 2001, age 54). Then invading Iraq (March 2003, age 57). Then... and then... too many wars!

				<p class=""survey-question"">What was your very first job? How long did you have it?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">UAW union member; assembly line mechanic, Kenworth Trucks Manufacturing; rolled into draftsman/engineer. Had this job for 4 years while working on my B.S. in Mechanical Engineering.</p>

					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What was the last song that got stuck in your head?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Probably some reggae song by Bob Marley. In 1995, I took the black father of my black grandson, Kinjah, to Jamaica for Bob Marley's 50th birthday celebration, while Kinjah was still in his mamma's belly. We spent 3 weeks on the island, celebrating Bob, and enjoying the culture and music.

Kinjah is now 25 years old, and an up-and-coming Hiphop/Rap musician/lyricist, under his handle \""Rize Tha Rebel\""

				<p class=""survey-question"">What qualities does the U.S. House of Representatives possess that makes it unique as an institution?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">The qualities that make it unique are in the very name itself: \""representative\"" of, for and by the people. We need to take back, repair and rebuild our \""government for the people, of the people, and by the people\"" from the massive sabotage and damage the Republican Party and their leader-cult has done to it.

The House is a deliberative body, which discusses, argues, debates, and inquires about factors that influence the best policy for our country. It is a body where individual representatives can express their view and lead on issues important for our collective future. A member of the House is not only a representative for their respective district; but a national position as well, since so many local issues are affected by national policy.

If elected, I'm not going to Washington to \""reach across the goddamn aisle\""! That metaphor implies everyone leads with their ideology, and the solution to the ineffective stagnation in Congress is some sort of compromised blend of ideologies - just to get something-anything-done. That's not the goal. It ignores the new political landscape of the next 10 years; and it misconstrues the scope and urgency of what we are up against.  Republicans always lead with their capitalist ideology - all solutions to anything must be packaged with their mantra of \""privatization, smaller government, less regulation,\"" meaning \""let the rich oligarchs, plutocrats and corporate executives decide everything,\"" driven by their sole purpose of grown money for those who already have the most money-the more the better, the faster the better. This Business As Usual (BAU) approach is what is destroying our planet. Republicans do not hold the answers for our nightmare of problems; they are not the ones to look to for solutions.

The proper focus must be on problem solving. What threats do we face; and how can we best solve them. That will be my focus. So, I'll go to Washington to fight for our future and lead on climate - educate, debate, persuade.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Do you believe that it's beneficial for representatives to have previous experience in government or politics?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">No, in general. In fact, we need new thinking and new ideas to address the crises we are facing. The model is AOC and her cohort of new representatives. She is a leader; someone who has the strength, knowledge and courage to take on the corporate, oligarch and political establishment. Think about how much \""dead wood\"" there is from these entrenched \""experienced\"" politicians who only serve their money masters. To most, it seems it's a game of collecting money for the next election.

One of my fellow candidate competitors is a professional politician, and tries to sell her knowledge of lower-level (county and state) legislative processes and her ability to \""reach across the aisle\"" as an experienced politician as the gem of her candidacy. \""I get along with everyone.\"" But, \""everyone,\"" including her, does this job for the first time at some point in their lives. One learns how to be part of the legislative and political process. What's important is one's ability to properly define and address problems; and their ability to be simultaneously tough and respectful. What's important is one's ability to lead others to a proper understanding of policy problems and the best way to successfully address them. It's far past time to entertain BAU ideological approaches that have demonstrated their manifest failure in protecting our future.

Besides being an officer in the military, I did work as a project leader in long-range planning with the U.S. Forest Service, and learned what it takes to implement policy, like the National Forest Management Act of 1976, under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). That is helpful. So, even though I've never held elective public office, I am an experience problem solver. After working in industry and government for 20 years; I've been an industrial consultant addressing a wide variety of problems in various diverse industries. I know how to tackle tough problems; I know how to work with difficult clients and get things done.</p>

					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What do you perceive to be the United States’ greatest challenges as a nation over the next decade?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">The greatest challenge of the United States, our world and humanity, is the existential threat of global climate catastrophe - now manifesting as a blazing climate emergency. There is nothing more serious. Our climate is rapidly destabilizing, and we are witnessing its destabilizing effects on the precarious balance of our global ecosystems, our marine food web, and our food and water security.

But that cannot be divorced from a system-wide intersectional perspective, because everything is interconnected and related to everything else.  Yes, we need to take on the fossil fuel industry for their corruption and criminal malfeasance in preventing earlier action. Yes, we need to drive carbon emissions down to zero, and drive carbon out of our economy. Yes, we need massive investments and research into climate mitigation and alternative energy sources, for all sectors of the economy; especially the major sectors: electrical generation; transportation; and our building infrastructure.  We need a massive Federal infrastructure and jobs creation effort to accomplish this.

Therefore, we cannot \""nibble around the policy edges\"" and expect to be successful. We must address not only this immense challenge; but seize the opportunity to entirely transform out country, as Bernie Sanders puts forth to the revolutionary movement he is leading. 2020 is the endgame for the future. We either turn the corner NOW (2020 election); or we will miss the last opportunity to preserve a chance for some semblance of future climate stability. All the policies Bernie has proposed and brought forth are part of that integrated effort: transforming our healthcare system; our education system and how we pay for it; our local economies; and protecting our environment and natural resources.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">If you are not a current representative, are there certain committees that you would want to be a part of?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Committees that deal with, and have policy power over, climate and energy, natural resources and environment, and our functioning economy as a whole.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What are your thoughts on term limits?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Absolutely not! When a politician's time is due; someone like AOC will come along and replace them. I don't want a Bernie Sanders or AOC to be thrown out over some cemented in rule, like term limits.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">If you are not currently a member of your party’s leadership in the U.S. House of Representatives, would you be interested in joining the leadership? If so, in what role?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I want to be in a position where I can influence policy about climate, energy and our future. I really don't care about labels and a party-climbing resume. I want to solve problems; big problems. So, I'd make individual appointment decisions based on that guidance.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Is there a particular representative, past or present, whom you want to model yourself after?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Both sitting representatives and candidates for office hear many personal stories from the residents of their district. Is there a story that you’ve heard that you found particularly touching, memorable, or impactful?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Absolutely. On my recent campaign trip covering all 29 counties in our large rural Colorado 3rd District, I met a couple in Mineral County, town of Creede, Colorado, who shared their heart-breaking story with me. They were in their late 50s. The gentleman was a 17-year employee of the town's water and sanitation department. He incurred an injury that debilitated him for a year, causing him to lose his job. Which caused him to lose his health insurance. His wife got cancer, which he was even more concerned about. With no health insurance, their meager savings for retirement has been rapidly bled away by medical expenses, now with hardly anything left, they told me. They're struggling, and not too hopeful. So, they were particularly interested in MFA, and how I would fight for it.

That was the first major personal story I heard on the campaign trail, where Medicare For All would have fully protected their financial situation while providing for all the medical care they needed. The lady even had to travel five hours to a city on the Front Range, where she could be treated. So, transportation was a big issue, because the drugs made her sleepy and increased the risk of an accident during her weekly lengthy trips. Also, there was the costs for a place to stay for the two days she would get her treatments. 

It was profound to hear this story directly, sitting next to struggling couple. It underscored my drive to get Bernie Sanders elected as president, and get myself elected as the 3rd District Representative to help support Bernie's policies, and fight for a viable future for these folks, and everyone of us facing similar circumstances.</p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">Please list below 3 key messages of your campaign. What are the main points you want voters to remember about your goals for your time in office?</p>
				<ul class=""key-messages"">
					<li>We must take big money out of politics.</li>
					<li>We must reform Congress and make it do its job.</li>
					<li>We must create competitive legislative districts and adopt term limits for Congress.</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
							<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What areas of public policy are you personally passionate about?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">The greatest issue of our generation is the simple fact that Congress does not work.   It has yielded most of its power to the Executive over a long period of time and  no longer performs the role given it in our Constitution. It is controlled not by the people or their representatives, but by the vulgar and obscene amount of money, and its corrupting influence, poured into it, the self-interest of career politicians and leadership that controls the country's agenda, even if that agenda is opposed by an overwhelming majority of the people. If we do not fix this problem, and the dysfunctional gridlock it has created, we will never be able to address or resolve the many important issues facing our country.   We also may soon lose our Constitution and our cherished heritage of representative government.  This is an election that will decide for generations what sort of country we are going to be.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Who do you look up to? Whose example would you like to follow, and why?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Congressman David Crockett and Senator John McCain.  I admire them because they were political mavericks who stood for what they thought was right, regardless of Party or President.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">

					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What do you perceive to be the United States’ greatest challenges as a nation over the next decade?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Our greatest challenge will be fixing the way Congress does it's business to make it more responsive,  work better and harder on the people's  real business and perform its constitutional role as a check on the power of the executive.  As part of this, Congress has a vital role in changing the tone and tenor of our politics so that it works for the country and its people.</p>

				<p class=""survey-response"">I am a life-long Hudson County resident and lawyer whose professional life has focused on preventing criminals and terrorist organizations from laundering funds through our financial system.  This is an unprecedented grassroots campaign to give working class Americans in New Jersey's 8th Congressional District a voice in our political destiny by: shining a light on the rising cost of housing, fixing the dysfunctional healthcare system, and rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure. Americans are disgusted with the political gamesmanship in Washington, and I am the only Democrat is running to break the gridlock and show that WE DESERVE BETTER!</p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">Who are you? Tell us about yourself in 300 words or less.</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I am running for Congress because the progressive people of District-16 are struggling with housing, healthcare, retirement security, and a lack of jobs, but our representative has been more concerned with diverting our public money to endless wars and unnecessary prisons.

I'm Andom Ghebreghiorgis, and I grew up in Mount Vernon, NY to parents who emigrated from Eritrea. I have a younger brother and sister and an enormous extended family scattered throughout the world.

I attended Lincoln School in Mount Vernon and then Fieldston, in Riverdale, for middle and high school. I graduated from Yale with degrees in Political Science and Economics in 2007. After working at the Robin Hood Foundation, I became a NYC Teaching Fellow in 2009 (I received my Master's in Secondary Special Education at CCNY). I taught MS special education at a renewal school in the Bronx (MS 113) and then was a SPED coordinator/ELA teacher at The Equity Project in Washington Heights.  I have written a children's book (Undercover BMX), led workshops on infusing AAVE into English curricula, taught free SAT courses to low-income students, and organized against out-of-school suspensions.

Outside of education, I have been active in Eritrean human rights and Palestinian justice spaces.

I love playing basketball, flag football, &amp; chess. I am a die-hard Knicks and Giants fan, and same goes for Rangers and Yankees (but I'm not as passionate as I was in the 90s). I also attend a lot of intl. soccer matches!</p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">Please list below 3 key messages of your campaign. What are the main points you want voters to remember about your goals for your time in office?</p>
				<ul class=""key-messages"">
					<li>Securing economic justice for all people through a federal job guarantee, single-payer Medicare-for-All, affordable housing for all, and greater union power</li>
					<li>Divesting from the military industrial complex and pursuing new multilateralism necessary for Global Green New Deal</li>
					<li>Fighting for racial justice by advocating for reparations, ending mass incarceration, abolishing ICE and CBP, and fully-funding 3K-16 public education</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
							<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What areas of public policy are you personally passionate about?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">As a first-generation American of Eritrean descent, as a black person, and as a special education teacher, many of these policy areas have affected me personally:
- School-to-Prison Pipeline, Special Education, LGBTQ+ Inclusive Education, School Integration
- Global Green New Deal, Foreign Policy of Peace and Decolonization, Immigrant and Refugee Rights, UNSC Reform
- Federal Job Guarantee, Homes Guarantee, Medicare for All
- Reparations for Black and indigenous Americans
- Workplace Democracy
</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Who do you look up to? Whose example would you like to follow, and why?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">My parents and the Eritrean activists of their generation (born between the 40s and 60s) have always been a personal model. They struggled against seemingly impossible odds to liberate Eritrea and sacrificed so much to do it. Some spent decades on the front, putting off families; others gave up personal/professional ambitions in order to be able to better devote themselves to the cause. My parents, in particular, continued their resistance as immigrants in a foreign land. They were tethered to multiple worlds, fully at home in none, but they had solidarity with all fighting injustice and love for everyone. I know, when they were teenagers, they wouldn't have ever thought that they'd spend nearly their whole lives fighting for a free Eritrea or that they'd only visit their homeland once in the last 50 years. Their optimism, hope, and resilience under these circumstances has always inspired me.</p>

					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Is there a book, essay, film, or something else you would recommend to someone who wants to understand your political philosophy?</p>

					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What characteristics or principles are most important for an elected official?</p>

Empathy

Openness and transparency

Ability to reflect critically
</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What qualities do you possess that you believe would make you a successful officeholder?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I am of the people I seek to represent. I am from the district, and I taught in the district. I have a first-person understanding of what our communities need, and my experiences enable me to articulate that genuinely.

My own personal history informed my unyielding commitment to fighting for the rights of and justice for all people. WEB Du Bois spoke about being black in America as having a \""double-consciousness,\"" and I can say growing up as the black American child of Eritrean immigrants that I felt a triple-consciousness. There can be extreme trauma and difficulty in growing up and living in America as a first-generation black person: from cultural dislocation to coming to terms with a white supremacist history of exploitation. The fact that many immigrant parents don't have language or awareness to help us navigate the problems of race and racism here can exacerbate our struggle. 

But there is also a blessing that comes from being racialized into marginalization: the opportunity and necessity for radical empathy. Even if they were not all directly my histories, I felt the pain of slavery, segregation, racism, genocide, and colonialism in me as a black person. I knew how hypocritical it would be for me to, even latently, support any system of oppression, when I understood the feeling of being oppressed myself.  I certainly don't believe blackness or a group's history of marginalization is a prerequisite for radical empathy, but, for me, this understanding helped me unpack my own privilege at a young age, helped me stand in solidarity with other oppressed groups, and helped serve as a foundation for my own activism and work in education. It bestowed upon me a liberatory politics that critiqued and questioned a status quo built on and sustained by imperialism, racism, heteropatriarchy, and economic exploitation, and affirmed that the artifice of stability should never preclude people's right to freedom, equality, and justice.

					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What do you believe are the core responsibilities for someone elected to this office?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Representing the constituency is the primary responsibility for the person elected to this office. 

Constituents need to be heard, and it is our responsibility to listen to their concerns, be present for them in the community, and develop a team to help address the needs of the district as a whole as we advocate for social justice.

It's also our responsibility to engage the district, keep constituents informed, and maintain a dialogue with the community. Organizing around issues is how we will work with our constituency to develop legislation that impacts the district and its residents.

			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What legacy would you like to leave?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">That we fought to dismantle the structures that keep people in poverty and struggled for justice for working people and historically marginalized groups</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What is the first historical event that happened in your lifetime that you remember? How old were you at the time?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I remember the 1992 Presidential Election just because of Ross Perot. I guess they would make fun of his ears on TV, and, as a 2nd grader at the time, it was the only funny thing that came out of my parents' nightly news-watching. In school, when friends would joke with each other, they'd sometimes compare one's ears to Ross Perot as a \""diss.\"" It's a really odd first political memory.

Less random, and more politically significant, I remember the celebrations for Eritrea's independence in 1993. Also that same year, I remember the World Trade Center Bombing.

			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What is your favorite book? Why?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Unfair question...how to choose?! The book that had the greatest impact on me - during my formative, teenage years - is The Autobiography of Malcolm X. Growing up in America, we internalize so much anti-blackness. For me, Malcolm X was the antidote to the identity complexes I had subconsciously struggled with for the better part of my 15 years at that point. This was not because I agreed with everything Malcolm X said or did in the book, but it was very empowering to feel like you were in the shoes of someone who, in the face of virulent, murderous white supremacy, was unabashedly black. It countered the dominant narrative that we had been fed through media-propagated stereotypes and Eurocentric curricula that excluded our histories. Additionally, Malcolm X represented the redemptive possibility of humanity. He went from prison to one of the most respected Black Americans ever. He preached a dogmatic fundamentalism and then admitted he was wrong. He made mistakes and tried to learn from them, which is, at minimum, what we should all be trying to do. He was always trying to do better: for himself, for all of us. Unfortunately, he was never given a full shot.</p>

					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Do you believe that it's beneficial for representatives to have previous experience in government or politics?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Political experience as a prerequisite for office is a double-edged sword. While serving in government may help a candidate understand how to navigate various systems, prior government experience may also blind representatives from honestly serving their constituents and connecting with them in an authentic way. 

My experiences as a teacher have prepared me well to lead my district in the years ahead. Teachers see the frontline impact that government policy can have on a classroom, a community, and student's life. Teachers are capable of anything. Not only do we manage 35 teenagers in an underfunded classroom every second of every day, but we get our young people to believe in themselves when the world has told them they shouldn't. As a special education teacher, I have had to demystify education for many of my students, who may come into my 8th grade class on a 2ndgrade reading level. They've been failed every step of the way. Their challenge is real, and our job as teachers is to create a plan in concert with them and a whole host of diverse stakeholders in the community - social workers, parents, families, sports coaches, religious leaders, community-based organizations - to ensure their success. This is exactly what I will be doing in Congress for communities that have been underserved and disinvested from for too long, communities that don't see a way out, and for a country that has as little faith in government as my students did in school.</p>

			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">

				<p class=""survey-question"">Both sitting representatives and candidates for office hear many personal stories from the residents of their district. Is there a story that you’ve heard that you found particularly touching, memorable, or impactful?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">We were canvassing at Mount Vernon City Fest on a nice September Saturday. Hundreds of people from my city were enjoying the popup vendors, lively music, and positive atmosphere. As people walked down Gramatan Ave., I would engage with them about our campaign. Almost everyone was extremely warm and receptive, but one man became agitated when we spoke to him, raising his voice and cursing about the corrupt politicians that didn't care about people in Mount Vernon. He told me how he had been formerly incarcerated and that, after his release, it had become impossible for him to get a job. He said frustratingly that he sometimes felt as if he had no other option but to go back to illicit activities to survive.

I listened to this man and felt his pain. It was a pain that was the product of systemic neglect: pipelines and complexes that gave him little chance to escape and less reason to believe in the fairness of the system. After speaking with him about mass incarceration and job guarantees, he ended up saying he'd look into our campaign and spread the word, even though he never votes. Whomever he votes for is not what's important; what was so impactful was seeing him become willing to re-engage in a political process that has excluded him. Under 10% of people in District 16 turn out for elections because they don't believe engaging in politics will affect their material reality, and, as a result, the ruling class is able to entrench the status quo. The man whom I was speaking to, in that moment, re-entered a working-class movement that existed before and will exist after our campaign. We are happy to join him in the struggle for justice, locally and internationally.

				<p class=""survey-question"">Who are you? Tell us about yourself in 300 words or less.</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I earned a Bachelor of Science degree in communications from the University of Florida. Over the last 30 years, I have held senior level management roles in health insurance, homebuilding, development &amp; infrastructure, utilities, and clean energy in California, and nationwide. I'm an entrepreneur who has developed solutions to many issues that impact District 42.

My experience taught me valuable negotiating, communication, stakeholder engagement, regulatory, and policymaking skills that I will use in Congress. I understand the importance of having a representative who will work for the ""people"" when interacting with local, state, and federal government. Many times, government is focused on developing a strong tax base for maintaining the ""status quo"" and not for the benefit of the community. As the endorsed AFL- CIO candidate, I will be a champion for the people, not the powerful.

CA 42 is the growth center for the next 20+ years. This will mean increased traffic, additional strain on our energy and water infrastructure, a negative impact on our air quality, increased demand on our school districts, and police/fire resources. My vision is to protect the constituents and work with our local, state, and federal governments to create solutions for sustainable growth that doesn't raise taxes beyond the ability of our residents to pay.

To ensure our region has the resources needed to meet the challenges ahead, we need a leader who has the experience to lead in DC.</p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">Please list below 3 key messages of your campaign. What are the main points you want voters to remember about your goals for your time in office?</p>

					<li>I Will Be The Representative for Everyone in CA District 42 - Focusing on the Issues that Matter to The Residents</li>
					<li>I have over 30 years experience in housing, infrastructure &amp; development, health insurance, sustainable &amp; clean energy</li>

							<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What areas of public policy are you personally passionate about?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I have spent the last 12 years working to promote California's Energy Efficiency Long-Term Strategic Plan. This plan was designed to ensure that California would be able to reach the goal of all residential homes to be Net Zero Energy by 2020.  Through the dedication and hard work of the CEC, CPUC, stakeholders, utilities, NGOs, builders, manufacturers, trade partners, and other community-based organizations, we have reached our 2020 goal and are focused on the next goal - to have all energy used in CA to be provided by renewable sources by 2045. I have worked tirelessly to protect California's environment and our air quality.  I will take that passion and experience to DC to ensure that we do not have any legislation that will impact our state's valuable environment.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Who do you look up to? Whose example would you like to follow, and why?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I look up to Jackie Speier, Congressional Rep from CA. Throughout her esteemed career, she has shown grace, resilience, tenacity, compassion, intelligence, and professionalism with all her colleagues, the media, her constituents, staff, and stakeholders.  She is one of the most admired congresswomen and has a reputation for working across the aisle to develop legislation that meets the needs of all constituents.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What characteristics or principles are most important for an elected official?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I believe the most important characteristics of an elected official are:

Integrity
Honesty
Compassion
Professionalism
Real-Life Experience in Policy Issues</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What do you believe are the core responsibilities for someone elected to this office?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">The core responsibilities of a Congressional Representative are:

1. Being knowledgeable of the needs of the District.
2. Managing a strong, knowledgeable, and professional staff that is focused on bringing the needs of the constituents to the representative.
3. Providing an open and transparent communication process for constituents.
4. Holding regularly scheduled town halls to hear directly from the constituents.
5. Representing the district with professionalism, honesty, integrity, and a collaborative spirit to work with local, state, and federal colleagues.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What legacy would you like to leave?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I have worked for over 30 years to create beautiful, sustainable, and affordable master-planned communities throughout the country.  For the last 12 years, I have worked with the state of California to promote energy efficiency and sustainable energy. I would like to leave a legacy of moving our country forward to a sustainable future.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What is your favorite book? Why?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Cider House Rules

It was an education about how horrible women's lives were in the 1920s without access to birth control and safe, affordable abortions. This book had a huge impact on my personal opinion about abortion.</p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">If you could be any fictional character, who would you want to be?</p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">What was the last song that got stuck in your head?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Believe by Mumford &amp; Sons</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What qualities does the U.S. House of Representatives possess that makes it unique as an institution?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">The size of the House of Representatives brings a disparate group of individuals together to work on policies that impact everyone in the country. The democratic nature of the organization gives the House a unique opportunity to have a wide variety of \""voices\"" to be heard from across the country. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Do you believe that it's beneficial for representatives to have previous experience in government or politics?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I don't think that it is important for representatives to have previous government experience. I think it is important that a represent truly \""represents\"" their district based on demographics, sociographics, psychographics, and real-life experience in the issues that matter to the district's constituents.
</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What do you perceive to be the United States’ greatest challenges as a nation over the next decade?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">The United States' greatest challenge is to become \""united\"" again. The last three years have created such division among the populace, that we have no sense of what is in the best interest of the \""greater good\"" of our country anymore. The president and Congress will have to take the lead to bring the country back together and show how we can work with others, no matter party, ideology, background, economic status, or religious affiliation.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">If you are not a current representative, are there certain committees that you would want to be a part of?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I would like to be a part of:
Energy &amp; Commerce
Energy &amp; Natural Resources
Environment &amp; Public Works
Health, Education, Labor &amp; Pensions
Energy &amp; Commerce
Natural Resources</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Do you believe that two years is the right term length for representatives?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I believe that two years is too short of a term for representatives.  The campaign process is so time-consuming, that the rep spends their second year focused on campaigning, not on doing work for the people.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What are your thoughts on term limits?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I think we should have term limits for both the House &amp; the Senate.  House of Representatives should be limited to 10 years, and Senators should be limited to 12 years.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">If you are not currently a member of your party’s leadership in the U.S. House of Representatives, would you be interested in joining the leadership? If so, in what role?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Yes, I would like to be in a leadership role in the area of communications. I believe our party needs assistance in communicating their policy positions, and the major differences between the parties to ensure that everyone understands what &amp; why we are fighting to develop policies that will meet the needs of the average American.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Is there a particular representative, past or present, whom you want to model yourself after?</p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">Who are you? Tell us about yourself in 300 words or less.</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">My name is Alaina Shearer, and I'm running to beat Troy Balderson in Ohio's 12th Congressional District. I'm running for a million reasons. The first 700,000 are the people of District 12, including my children. As a business owner, a mother and an American, I can not choose to stand down and watch as our current representative continues to choose partisan politics over all else. 

In my life, I have faced personal loss, single motherhood, highs and lows as a business owner, and sexual harassment. But in every case, I have picked myself back up, turning each challenge into a lesson-learned and a new opportunity. I have fought to forge a path not only for myself, but for all others behind me.

I see it as a patriotic duty, and my greatest honor ever, to be a Democratic Candidate for Ohio's 12th Congressional District.</p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">Please list below 3 key messages of your campaign. What are the main points you want voters to remember about your goals for your time in office?</p>
				<ul class=""key-messages"">
					<li>Affordable Healthcare: The first priority must be stabilizing and restoring the Affordable Care Act in order to maintain coverage for those with pre-existing conditions, and to ensure that everyone has the choice to be covered under a public option. No American should ever have to go bankrupt or die because of the cost of healthcare. I support an immediate action to create an income-based cap on the amount any individual or family should pay out of pocket on medical expenses, including prescriptions. </li>
					<li>Small Business Protection: 50% of small businesses fail within the first 5 years. This is because they do not receive the protections or support they need from the government the way that huge corporations do. I want to make sure that small business owners and employees feel supported and heard by their representative. I know what it takes to keep a business afloat. I am committed to defending small businesses in Washington.</li>
					<li>Women's Rights: After experiencing gender inequality in several jobs and several fields, I began a national Women's network for women in digital and tech careers. As a result of this powerful network, women have negotiated pay raises, paid maternity leave and healthcare coverage.  It's time to end pay inequities in America based on gender, race and sexual orientation. I am a passionate advocate for equal pay, paid family leave and for creating the structural change needed to tear down the barriers that keep women of all backgrounds from achieving everything they can.</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
							<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What areas of public policy are you personally passionate about?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">As a mother, I am passionate about giving my children a future in this country. This means protecting all civil liberties, taking measures to make sure they are safe from gun violence and protecting the environment, just to name a few. 

As the daughter of a physician who took care of people regardless of their ability to pay, I am passionate about creating affordable healthcare and finding new paths forward to combat the opioid crisis.

As the daughter of a small-business owner and as a small-business owner myself, I am passionate about protecting small businesses and ensuring that corporations pay their fair share, just like we do.

As a woman, I am passionate about ensuring women's and minorities' rights are protected everywhere, including in the workplace. We need equal pay, and workers need to maintain collective bargaining rights in order to advocate for themselves and others.

				<p class=""survey-question"">Who are you? Tell us about yourself in 300 words or less.</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Alp is an attorney, human rights advocate, and community organizer from Fort Lee, NJ.

Alp arrived in New Jersey when he was four years old and grew up undocumented. His parents did not speak English, and they worked at minimum wage jobs in the hopes that Alp might one day achieve the American Dream.  

After graduating Fort Lee High School, Alp attended Vanderbilt University, graduating magna cum laude with three majors and two honors theses. &nbsp;Alp then went on to receive a law degree from UCLA School of Law.

After racking up an absurd amount of student loan debt, Alp moved back to Fort Lee and worked as a corporate lawyer in Manhattan for nearly a decade.  In addition, Alp provided free legal services for persecuted LGBTQ and HIV+ refugees and twice received the Immigration Equality Safe Haven Award.

Alp continues to live in Fort Lee with his wife and two small children.</p>

				<p class=""survey-response"">We must save the American Dream. Our greatest strength as a country is that our dreams define who we are as a people. Our dreams make us uniquely American and give our communities strength and resilience. It is a national soul more powerful than any other. It has allowed us to surpass the rest of the world in every way imaginable. America is the American Dream, and our values will reignite it!

We have entered a dark era in America. Wealth inequality has reached historic proportions, and an entire presidency is now devoted to further entrenching that inequality. We will fight back and save the American Dream through our single-payer healthcare, education for all, and immigration amnesty policies, as well as our racial justice, Green New Deal, and anti-corruption plans.  </p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">Who are you? Tell us about yourself in 300 words or less.</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I am the daughter of working class parents (Dad was and oilfield electrician and Mom was a school secretary) who instilled in me an intense work ethic. I am the first in my family to attend college: I have a Bachelor's in Secondary Education, a Master's in Biology, a Master's in Cell Physiology and Molecular Biophysics and a Doctorate in Reproductive Physiology. I worked my way through college and completed most of my education while being a mom and wife. I am a wife of 29 years, a mom of 3, and a Nana of 1 grandson. I have been a foster parent, worked with food insecure and homeless college students, worked to create gender equality in the workplace, and improve conditions for student athletes and graduate students. My hobbies and interests include gardening, bee keeping, cycling, visiting and hiking state and national parks. I don't know the meaning of ""quit"", or ""it can't be done"", and I don't hold with the excuse"" that is the way it has always been"". TX-12 is a diverse district representing urban, rural and suburban living, and an equally diverse economy including industrial manufacturers, farms and ranches, and small businesses. TX-12 needs someone who understands and appreciates this diversity and will meet with the people and represent them in Washington.  </p>

						    <div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Please list below 3 key messages of your campaign. What are the main points you want voters to remember about your goals for your time in office?</p>
				<ul class=""key-messages"">
					<li>As a scientist and educator, the outright denial of scientific facts and the attack on public education by this administration and its supporters was the driving factor for me to run for Congress.</li>
					<li>My doctorate in reproductive physiology My doctorate in reproductive physiology makes me a champion for women's reproductive health. This includes comprehensive sex education, access to reliable birth control and women's health professionals, and the right to medical decisions for their own bodies including  medically safe abortions. </li>
					<li>As a college professor that teaches pre-health care professionals, I understand how broken our healthcare system is. As a country we must address the disparity in the availability and access to healthcare for everyone.</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
							<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What areas of public policy are you personally passionate about?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">•	Healthcare: Without access to healthcare we are holding our population hostage, most people are one disease, medical incident, or accident away from financial disaster. People are living suboptimal lives because they cannot receive preventive care, medication to treat manageable diseases, or treatment/surgeries that would allow them to work and carry out daily activities.  
•	Climate Change: It is undeniable that the 7.5 billion people on earth today are having an impact on the environment and adding to the unprecedented levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.
•	Women's' absolute right to control when and if they have children.
</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Who do you look up to? Whose example would you like to follow, and why?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I look up to my students. I teach at a community college and each and everyday I see students coming to class while working a full time job, taking care of children and parents, and putting in the hours to study and come to class. Most of my students' goal is to work as a healthcare profession, nurse, respiratory therapist, physical therapy assist, etc. They choose to do this not only to improve their own lives but because they want to help others. They believe this is the land of opportunity and they are making their American Dream a reality.  I know their struggles, I have been in their shoes, and I am proud every time one of them walks across the graduation stage because I know the sacrifices and hard work they put in to being there. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Is there a book, essay, film, or something else you would recommend to someone who wants to understand your political philosophy?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Half the Sky: Turning Oppression into Opportunity for Women Worldwide by Nicholas D Kristof and Sheryl WuDunn.  While this book takes a world view of the treatment of women it causes us to remember where we have been in the United States, how much progress has been made, and all that we still need to address for women to truly have equality. It also shows how important education and healthcare are to the prosperity and success of a country. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What characteristics or principles are most important for an elected official?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">First and foremost I think an elected official should have a service mentality. They need to be strong and firm but have the ability to be humble and work with others for the best solutions to todays issues. They must know their limitations and seek advice from experts outside their own areas of expertise. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What qualities do you possess that you believe would make you a successful officeholder?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">My background in science has prepared me to dissect and solve complex problems, to understand that solutions are a process, and to rely on others to bring their expertise to the table.  We need more of this in Washington. I understand that elected officials should go to Washington with a service mentality, politics should not be a lifelong career, and that diversity and differing opinions add to the collective strength. In my life and career, I have worked steadfastly to improve the lives of foster children, students, athletes, fellow graduate students, and faculty members. I will take the same drive and service mentality to Washington with me. I plan to make sure that I communicate effectively and listen to the people of my district by having open townhalls, being available when in district for meetings, and to make sure that my office is responsive to the needs and requests of the constituents. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What do you believe are the core responsibilities for someone elected to this office?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Listen to and represent the best interest of all the people in your district. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What legacy would you like to leave?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I want to leave a legacy of people. People that believe I have helped them obtain their goals and helped them live a more fulfilling life. I want my legacy to be of someone that stood up for what was right, what was just, and what was best  for people.  </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What is the first historical event that happened in your lifetime that you remember? How old were you at the time?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">The most historical event that i really remember was the bicentennial celebration of the Declaration of Independence in 1976. I was 9 years old. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What was your very first job? How long did you have it?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I worked as a carhop at the age of 14. It was a summer job that I worked for 2 summers. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What is your favorite book? Why?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">The Harry Potter series are my favorite books. My favorite memories from when my children were growing up was reading these book to them while we were either piled into the pick-up or hanging out in the travel trailer on one of our long road trips. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">If you could be any fictional character, who would you want to be?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I'm gong to stick with the Harry Potter theme and say either Molly Weasley, or Professor Minerva McGonagall.   Molly Weasley was a fierce protector of her family. No apologies are made for her choice to stay at home and take care of her family or the fact that she has 6 children. When it comes down to it she shows great courage in protecting her family. Professor Minerva McGonagall is a strong independent woman that has found purpose in teaching. She shows compassion for her students while having high expectations of them at the same time. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What was the last song that got stuck in your head?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Help! by The Beatles</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What is something that has been a struggle in your life?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">My daughter was born with a genetic defect which caused her to be mentally and physically disabled. This has been the greatest struggle of my life. Every day I ask myself: Does she have what she needs? Is she living her life to the fullest? What can I do to reduce the struggles and frustrations she faces every day? How do I communicate these things to those of you reading this without her feeling exploited or used? For a parent it comes in waves. First you are dealing with a newborn, digesting the information, and working to find medical care. Next you are dealing with schools and how to make sure your child is getting the services and accommodations she needs. Then you are having to explain to her why she struggles to have friends and that there are going to limitations to what she can do. The worry is constant, worrying about whether they are going to be able to learn to drive, get a job, live an independent life, and be happy. Because of her I learned to stand up and fight for another person's rights. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What qualities does the U.S. House of Representatives possess that makes it unique as an institution?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">The short term limits for representatives requires that they be more responsive to the people they represent. Smaller more localized districts provide more diversity in the House of Representatives and local representation.  </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Do you believe that it's beneficial for representatives to have previous experience in government or politics?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I can be beneficial but it is not necessary nor desirable that every representative comes from a background in government or politics.  We should look for people that have demonstrated leadership, the ability to problem solve, a service mentality, and the fortitude to do what is right for their constituents and country regardless of pressure from corporations, lobbyists, or their party. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What do you perceive to be the United States’ greatest challenges as a nation over the next decade?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Cyber security is and will continue to be one of the greatest challenges we face. Not only is our military and national information at risk, but everything that keeps our country running, such as transcontinental pipelines, traffic, electrical grids, manufacturing, and financial institutions. We think of this in terms of hackers getting into systems, but we are also vulnerable to the misuse of social media to create and amplify division in our country, to influence elections, and to influence public opinion on policies such as vaccinations. 
We also must be attentive to the more mundane tasks and purposes of our government. Roads, bridges, and railways my not be exciting but we must invest in infrastructure, not only creating new infrastructure but making the necessary repairs to infrastructure already in place. We cannot move forward as a county if we can't move our people, goods, first responders, and security forces where they need to be. If you want to see people riled up over something find a good pothole. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">If you are not a current representative, are there certain committees that you would want to be a part of?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">The committees that best align with my areas expertise and the of interests of both myself and my district are the Agriculture, Armed Forces, Education and Labor, Natural Resources, Science, Space and Technology, Small Business, Transportation and Infrastructure, and Veterans Affairs. This is a long list but the diversity and the concerns in my district are wide ranging. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Do you believe that two years is the right term length for representatives?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I think that two year terms cause representatives to constantly be campaigning and it doesn't give them time to focus on the job at hand and to have meaningful conversations with their constituents. For a first time representative there is hardly no time between starting their term and then starting to campaign for the next cycle. It is extremely difficult for constituents to determine how a newly elected representative is performing before it is time to vote again. The plus side to short terms for representatives is that they must be very responsive to their constituents, at least early in their political career, or they will not last long.  I think that three or four year terms would be more appropriate. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What are your thoughts on term limits?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I believe our government was designed so that our representatives were service minded and I believe in term limits. I do think that it does take some time for a person to get good at their job and to start making an impact so I think that a person should be limited to six terms as a representative and two terms as a Senator. </p>
			</div>

				<p class=""survey-question"">If you are not currently a member of your party’s leadership in the U.S. House of Representatives, would you be interested in joining the leadership? If so, in what role?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Yes, undecided. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Is there a particular representative, past or present, whom you want to model yourself after?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">While there are many political leaders in our history that are worthy of admiration because they served with dignity and persevered in the most hostile and adverse environments to accomplish great things, the person I want to take this opportunity to highlight Gabrielle Gifford. Gabby Gifford was doing her job communicating and meeting with constituents in a Safeway parking lot when she was the victim of an assassination attempt, one that killed six and wounded eighteen others. After surviving this attempt and while rehabilitating from her traumatic brain injury, she could have dropped out of public life. instead she continued to appear publicly and testified before the Senate. Since then she has not advocated against the second amendment but has advocated for reasonable gun regulations and to prevent those who should not own or have access to a gun from doing so. I would hope that I will show as much courage as Gabby Gifford has shown. </p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">Both sitting representatives and candidates for office hear many personal stories from the residents of their district. Is there a story that you’ve heard that you found particularly touching, memorable, or impactful?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">A college administrative assistant had her retirement all planned out to start in six months then she was diagnosed with breast cancer. Two years later she is free of the cancer but still working to pay off the bills from her treatments. Another is of a man that one day after his wife's funeral is in his tax prepares office discussing how to pay off what he owes to the IRS. His wife had cancer and they took money out of her retirement plan to pay for medical treatment. Because she died and they never paid back the money into her retirement they owed taxes on this money. She spent her last few days worrying about the money owed to the IRS and how he was going to manage. When we talk about healthcare we are not only talking about the uninsured, both of these women had worked their entire lives, had saved for retirement, and had GOOD health insurance. As the wealthiest nation in the world we cannot stand for this. </p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">Who are you? Tell us about yourself in 300 words or less.</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I am a lifelong inventor and have been internationally recognized for my humanitarian and environmental inventions since 1980. I had the honor of teaching k-6 for twelve years before becoming an engineer and scientist. As a teacher I began in the South Bronx in the late Eighties  and worked in both public and private schools in urban and rural settings, both as a teacher and administrator, before returning to school for my engineering degrees. In my career as an inventor I've had the privilege of working on projects as varied as the Gillette Venus to locking mechanisms of the Space Shuttle shuttle bay doors. Within engineering, I worked my way up to Director of Research and Development for a large multinational before starting my own humanitarian engineering company, WorldStove, which I've done full time since 2004.  In 2010 my company became the first in the world to be certified as carbon negative. I have been involved in the UN Climate Summits since 2008 and have been an advisor to the European Parliament on climate policy and solutions. I was recruited to help forge a strong Green New Deal and provide both short and long term proven actionable plans. </p>
			</div>
						    <div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Please list below 3 key messages of your campaign. What are the main points you want voters to remember about your goals for your time in office?</p>
				<ul class=""key-messages"">
					<li>I am in the unique position that the incumbent I am challenging and all of my opponents are good people. All, in their own way, have done and are doing important things. One is an unquestionable champion of bringing attention to veterans issues, another founded an amazing organization to help address the issues surrounding postpartum and the third has a proven track record of improving gun regulations.  These are all key issues and they have my full respect. I am running because the decades of experience I have are in fields that specifically are needed to address the most critical issues being faced by our district, the nation and the planet. </li>
					<li>I had never thought of running for Congress until I was asked if I would this past January.  For the past 23 years no occupant of the seat I am seeking has done anything significant with regards to the impending climate crisis, education, healthcare, or immigration reform, all areas I have expertise in. We can no longer wait to address these issues and the consequences of our collective inaction could result in a future that is so dire that I felt had no choice but to agree to run. I see it as my civic duty to use the experience and skills I have developed over four decades to help develop so that those that come after us will not have to pay for the consequences of our inaction</li>
					<li>Our congressional district is one that once shaped the nation and our world. MA6 was refuge to Fredrick Douglass when he escaped slavery. MA6 was where the notion of separation of church and state for our nation was conceived. In MA6 the people of Andover protested and were jailed for opposing new proposals to limit immigration when our nation was barely a decade old. With fish, labor, and ingenuity from Birdseye to Nikola Tesla our MA6 was the catalyst of our nation's economic prosperity. I see no reason why we can not reclaim our voice and shape our nation once again. Certainly, there has never been a time when our collective voices were more needed. </li>
				</ul>
			</div>
							<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What areas of public policy are you personally passionate about?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">ENVIRONMENT: That we are the only nation who has withdrawn from the Paris Climate Agreement bespeaks an unpardonable indifference to the problems we have caused. Germany still pays reparations for The Holocaust how can we then turn our backs on the destruction we have wreaked? We must come together, as a nation, with bold projects future generations will not have to pay the price for our inaction.  
EDUCATION: As someone who taught k-6 for 12 years, I know the value of education for I see how far my former students have gone with their lives. Just two decades ago the USA ranked number one globally in high-school and college education. We now are in 27th place. Until we recognize teachers as the single greatest contributors to our nation's prosperity and happiness we will continue to fall behind those nations that we must compete with in an ever more global marketplace. 
HEALTHCARE: Over the last two decades we have fallen from number one in healthcare among industrialized nations to 27th place. With over 30,000 people dying each year because of our current healthcare system and 500,000 families annually reduced to medically caused, why should we not not deserve the healthcare that all other developed nations benefit from? 
IMMIGRATION REFORM: Our immigration policy need not be an open door one, but it must provide a quick, affordable, and clear path to citizenship for all who wish to be part of our great nation or who, like so many of our ancestors, come seeking asylum.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Who do you look up to? Whose example would you like to follow, and why?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">If this question is limited to political figures, I have always looked up to President Jimmy Carter. During his time in office he started no wars and was never given the due credit he richly deserves for resolving the hostage crisis. Environmentally he lead by example putting the first, ever,  solar panels on The White House roof. After leaving office he has used his reputation to time and time again lead by example by helping the most needy and working tirelessly for world peace.  

If, however, this question is not limited to political figures I would like to think I am doing my best to follow in the very large steps taken by Buckminster Fuller. Buckminster Fuller was a visionary and dared to invent and create with an eye toward the grand scale. His focus was unwaveringly to do all he could for nature and mankind. He dared to dream big and the legacy he left behind was a world with renewed potential for good and sustainability </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What characteristics or principles are most important for an elected official?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Jimmy Carter and Sandro Pertini are two of my political heroes. Both served during roughly the same time period and both embodies that which Pertini declared was the duty of an elected official.   Pertini who was Italy's seventh President once said \""La moralità dell'uomo politico consiste nell'esercitare il potere che gli è stato affidato al fine di perseguire il bene comune\"". This roughly translates to \""it is the obligation for elected officials to use their power exclusively for the good of the people\"".  The good of the people, not the corporations, not the lobbyists, not other politicians. Both lead a life that by example far more than word embodied this noble aspiration. To me, there is no greater characteristics or principle for an elected official to have.
</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What qualities do you possess that you believe would make you a successful officeholder?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Be it in my life as a teacher, researcher, inventor, humanitarian, policy writer, industry executive, father and husband, I have always believed that there is no problem that cannot be solved. When, during the horrific 2010 earthquake in Haiti our humanitairan supplied were stolen we built a forge with scraps from the rubble and then made new equipment from whatever scrap we could find. These on the spot inventions were eventually used to feed 3000 refugees per day.  When as a teacher i saw students falling behind or not being sufficiently challenged within the mandated curriculum I offered a free after school program fro every-child in the school. In Rwanda I gained such a reputation for always resolving issues I was given the name of 'Umugabo w'igisubizo' which roughly translates to  The Solution Man.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What legacy would you like to leave?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I would like to be part of the team that rewrote the Green New Deal and got it passed ushering in an era of bountiful green jobs and an economy that not only respects the planet but everyone on it. 

I would like to help elevate the USA to once again being number one in the world for education. 

And when someday our now three-year-old twins   when they ask me if i did everything I could I woudl like to be able to say with pride, yes, we did. 

</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What is the first historical event that happened in your lifetime that you remember? How old were you at the time?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">In what seems extraordinarily relevant in these political times, my first historical memory was seeing my parents tape a photo of Spiro Agnew with vertical black construction paper bars on it and then getting into   an argument with my aunt and uncle  over it. I must have been seven or eight at the time. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What was your very first job? How long did you have it?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Like many who grew up in Western Massachusetts my very first job was at 13 picking cucumbers and tobacco. It was a summer job and taught me respect for all farm workers. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What is your favorite book? Why?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">My first degree was in literature and my thesis was on Moby Dick.   A few years ago that or the collected poems of Robert Frost would have been my default answers to such a question. Three years ago, however,  I miraculously became a papa' of twins and my daily, non work related, reading tends to be less erudite. A few weeks ago our daughter, who's three, brought home from the library a copy of The Pencil by Susan Avingaq and Maren Vsetula, illustrated by Charlene Chua.  The fact that I list the illustrator should be a tip off that this is not what one might consider classic literature. I think it's my current favorite book because it is the first story i have seen have such a profound impact on our daughter.  It's a story of an inuit family so poor that half a pencil or even a sheet of paper were considered  extravagances.  We live frugally but do not want for anything so to see how over night this changed how my daughter viewed the entire world was nothing short of magic. In the end,  is that not what great literature should do? For this reason it is my current favorite book. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">If you could be any fictional character, who would you want to be?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">My fondness for second breakfasts would certainly make being a Hobbit a possible choice but, if I could be anyone well then, give me a Tardis and call me The Doctor! </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What was the last song that got stuck in your head?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">My musical taste vary from classical to electronic pop but there is no denying my life long love of folk music. My musical hero is Elvis Costello and I am happy to sing (badly) any number of his songs with almost no insistence. THe last song that got stuck in my head was Billy Bragg's version of \""Which Side Are You On?\"". Originally written in 1931 by Florence Reece, I've always loved Pete Seeger's version but when I stumbled across the much more powerful version by Billy Bragg my old punkish roots were awakened and it remained stuck in my head for days. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What is something that has been a struggle in your life?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Having a tidy desk</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Do you believe that it's beneficial for representatives to have previous experience in government or politics?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I find it astounding that we as a society seems to be ok with underpaying teachers when they work 181 days a year, and are required to undergo constant training, onerous certification programs and more for a job that is one of the hardest and most critical to our nation's prosperity. I find it equally bewildering that members of Congress are paid generous salaries even though that work 121 days a year,  and who only have the requirements of being 25, a citizen and living in the district they wish to represent. I do believe it's beneficial for representatives to have previous experience but not necessarily in politics. I would love to see a one year requirement of having worked for minimum wage. I would love to see requirements of having been part of a labor union. I would love that those tasked with making laws about science or women's health were scientists or medical professionals and women. 
</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What do you perceive to be the United States’ greatest challenges as a nation over the next decade?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I am lucky enough, because of the career choices I have made, I have been fortunate to have worked all over the world. There is no question our nation is still legendary for many who dream of a world where success is based on effort and not who you know or what family or race you were born into. In one small coffee shop in Senegal, faded but in a place of honor hung a framed photo of John F Kennedy. For many that is still the USA, a place of opportunity, growth, progress like space programs and civil rights and an economy that was booming. There is no escaping that, for many, that is not the reality of today and outside the USA our reputation is not the shining beacon it once was. From 1st to 27th place among developing nations for education and healthcare in just 20 years to growing economic disparities and an immigration system that impedes innovation and rewards isolationism our reputation as the land of freedom and opportunity is fading.  I want to be part of a congress that fights to restore our global reputation to match that which prompts the coffee shop owner in Senegal to keep a portrait of our president on his shop wall. 
</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What are your thoughts on term limits?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">On this topic I am torn for I see some who have had long productive careers while other politicians do little more than keep a seat warm, if that.  The benefit of term limits is that the odds of defeating a do-nothing incumbent are infinitely small while the risk is losing someone who year after year puts their heart and soul into doing the job. Likewise it would be detrimental to lose the connections forged over time that are so critical in coming to bipartisan agreements. To address this conundrum perhaps the answer is to eliminate lobbyists and donor based campaign finance. Publicly funded elections would level the playing field and allow incumbents to be judged solely on their accomplishments. Do the job and stay, do nothing and get replaced. Having been in a leadership role in industry I can think of no situation other than the house where someone will be allowed to keep their job after doing nothing for two years, or longer.

			</div>
							<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What areas of public policy are you personally passionate about?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">The top three areas of public policy I'm passionate about are:

1) Economic Development- Which includes supporting small business growth and development, stabilizing markets for domestic family farmers (i.e. saving our safety net that feeds the nation's most needy populations, opening new markets such as hemp and medicinal marijuana), promoting fair pay and new industry and development in rural areas. 

2) Providing Affordable Healthcare: I support a public Medicare option that leaves private insurance intact. 

3) Saving Social Security, which includes ending mass incarceration (which takes millions of non-violent offenders out of the job market, who could be earning wages and paying into the social security system) and fixing the immigration system to encourage new tax revenue.
</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Who do you look up to? Whose example would you like to follow, and why?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I look up to Nelson Mandela. Mandela was unjustly incarcerated for 27 years, and upon release he held no bitterness and no malice. His gentle and kind heart, good character and  charisma allowed him to become the head of state in South Africa. I have also always respected Joseph in the Bible, who was thrown into prison and who eventually became the ruler of Egypt. I believe that these men are the perfect representation of the most important lesson in the Bible, that is the lesson of forgiveness. 

Oftentimes, people do things out of ignorance, and sometimes even out of malice. God calls upon us to forgive one another, because we all sin and fall short of the glory of God. We want to be forgiven for the sins we commit against our fellow man, so the Bible reminds us to forgive that we may be forgiven.  As a Christian, I use the Bible as my guidebook. I do, however, believe in the separation of church and state, so I don't expect everyone to share my religious convictions, but forgiving someone is an act of goodwill that anyone can exercise, regardless of our religious or  moral convictions or varying beliefs.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What qualities do you possess that you believe would make you a successful officeholder?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I believe that my experiences as a small business owner and education background in the areas of business and public policy has equipped me with a good understanding of how to craft policy. I think more than either of those is my passion for people and my ability to work across the aisle with people of various backgrounds will make me a great officeholder. I am a natural leader and naturally get along with all kinds of people. I have an intrinsic desire to seek justice and fairness for all people. I think this aspect of my character is what we need in office to balance the power and the stronghold that has been in existence for a very long time in DC.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What do you believe are the core responsibilities for someone elected to this office?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I believe the core responsibilities for someone elected to the office of Representative is to advocate for policies that are in the best interest of the constituents in her district.  The second core responsibility is to be a checks and balance to the executive branch of government.</p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">What legacy would you like to leave?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I want my legacy to be that I passed legislation to build light rail across Ohio, that paved the way to economic development across Ohio. I would also like to leave a legacy of having introduced and passed legislation to end mass incarceration and to bring an end to the school to prison pipeline. I also want to leave a legacy of creating a method for engaging citizens in the process of governing effectively.</p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">What is the first historical event that happened in your lifetime that you remember? How old were you at the time?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">The first historical event that happened in my lifetime that I remember was a very personal event. It was when I was a first grader and President Jimmy Carter visited our school. I got to shake the Presidents hand. It was a moment I never forgot, even at the tender age of 6 years old. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What was your very first job? How long did you have it?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">My very first job was with McDonald's. I started working there when I was 16 years old. I worked there for nearly a year, before I was recruited by a customer who was a Manager at Thom McAn Shoestore. The Manager thought I had excellent customer service skills and asked me to come and work for them. They paid me much more money and offered me more desirable hours, so it was an opportunity I couldn't resist.</p>

					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What is your favorite book? Why?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">My favorite book is Where Do We Go From Here, by Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. 

As a Kingian Scholar, I found a love for books written by Dr. King. His work is a demonstration of how far we've come and a reminder of how far we have yet to go. 

I also enjoy reading fiction, but it seems I never get time to read much for leisure. I recently enjoyed a book called The Storm by my Aunt Marian Gardner. I was also privileged with writing the forward for her book. I enjoyed the way she was able to weave so many relevant topics into her work of fiction. I also enjoyed the creative way she introduced her faith in her story.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">If you could be any fictional character, who would you want to be?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I would be Superman. I really like his concern for making the world right and how he balanced that with his career as a journalist and his romantic love for Lois Lane. I am happy to be the woman version of Superman, but Superwoman is not as appealing as a superhero as superman.</p>

					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What was the last song that got stuck in your head?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">\""If it had not been for the Lord on our side, tell me where would I be\""</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What is something that has been a struggle in your life?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">My greatest struggle in life has been single parenting my daughters after the loss of my husband. Parenting should be a two person job. Financially, it is a significant strain on one person. It is even more difficult to put two children through college as a single mother. My children were very active, which made it even more difficult for me. I remember the years that I was juggling their volleyball, basketball, soccer games and track meets. It was especially difficult because I often had to work several jobs to make ends meet in order to maintain the standard of living that they had grown accustomed to. I was running my consulting business and I was fortunate to be able to find online teaching jobs that enabled me to teach an hour per day a few days per week and I could grade papers when it was convenient for me. Before my husband died, I went back to school for my doctorate degree. My program required at least 20 hours of study per week, so at one point I was writing papers on the sidelines at sporting events and beachside on family vacations. I continued my studies after he died, and it was even more difficult to juggle my parenting duties, a doctoral program, my business and work life. My children are both adults now. One is pursuing her undergraduate degree, the other is gainfully employed full-time at a technology company in silicone valley. </p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">What qualities does the U.S. House of Representatives possess that makes it unique as an institution?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">The qualities that make the US House of Representatives a unique is the role of representing the people of the district. This entity should be a voice for the people. In recent years, the body seems to have lost it's way as a voice for the people and has become a voice for which ever corporate or special interest can provide the most money in campaign funds. We need to restore our government back to the people.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Do you believe that it's beneficial for representatives to have previous experience in government or politics?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I believe it is beneficial to have previous experience or at the very least an understanding of government and politics. I also believe that Congress should be made up of people from various backgrounds. Diverse groups tend to foster the most creative ideas.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What do you perceive to be the United States’ greatest challenges as a nation over the next decade?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I believe the biggest issue that we face as a nation is corruption in government. At the core of the problem is the fact that the rigged system is at the foundation of our governing structures. As long as money and partisan politics are allowed to prevail, we can expect to lose our standing as a world power at some point in the future. So far, our power base has been based on our economic power. We are quickly losing that edge as innovators and creators of the future and the greater percentage of our populace are not being prepared to live in the world as it will be in the future. 

We also have classism and  racial problems that plague our national identity and will play an important part in our survival as a nation. We must come to respect all Americans regardless of their economic standing or their background. Respecting difference will ensure that we protect the national interest of our country by equipping the best and the brightest to carry the torch for the next generation.

Finally, we face a future that we aren't prepared for. We are lacking in both skills for jobs of the future, and we have thus far failed to put any meaningful effort behind preparing for that future. We face a world with limited resources, such as water, oil, and many of the minerals that we need to sustain our current way of life. We need to open new markets for trade with African countries and those with untapped resources. We also need to redevelop our infrastructure to prepare for global warming and the need to move populations to higher ground, as our coastal cities are eroding and will soon be uninhabitable.</p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">If you are not a current representative, are there certain committees that you would want to be a part of?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I would be proud to serve on any committee that would benefit the 8th Congressional District. I think the following committees would best serve the interests of our district:

Agriculture
Appropriations
Budget
Education and Labor
Financial Services
Foreign Affairs
Judiciary
Oversight and Government Reform
Science, Space, and Technology
Small Business
Transportation and Infrastructure
Veterans' Affairs
Ways and Means</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">If you are a current representative, why did you join your current committees?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">N/A</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Do you believe that two years is the right term length for representatives?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">No, I believe that a more appropriate term is 4 years. This would allow a Representative to demonstrate that they can be effective in the role.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What are your thoughts on term limits?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I believe term limits can be a good thing. I would support  8 year term limits.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">If you are not currently a member of your party’s leadership in the U.S. House of Representatives, would you be interested in joining the leadership? If so, in what role?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I would not be interested in holding a leadership role this year, however perhaps after serving a couple of years I would be more inclined to feel qualified to lead.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Is there a particular representative, past or present, whom you want to model yourself after?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">No, I have no interest in cloning myself after anyone. I pride myself on being unique and offering all that I am to the role of representative.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Both sitting representatives and candidates for office hear many personal stories from the residents of their district. Is there a story that you’ve heard that you found particularly touching, memorable, or impactful?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">The stories that touch my heart the most are the cancer stories and the stories that parents tell me about the loss of their children. The most disheartening stories are the tragedies that could have been preventable. In 2018, a mother in Middletown told me the story of her son had died of an opioid addiction, and the story of a father that lost his daughter to opioid addiction two days before Easter and then a son two days before Christmas the same year.</p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">What would be your top three priorities, if elected?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">1. Medicare for All
2. Large-scale, bold climate action to retool our economy as proposed by the Green New Deal
3. Immigration overhaul — returning oversight of the immigration agencies from Homeland Security to the Justice Department, abolishing ICE, creating an effective work program, developing a pathway to citizenship for DREAMers and other immigrants, and funding processing of immigration cases</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What areas of public policy are you personally passionate about?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Labor law, immigration law, and foreign policy.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Who do you look up to? Whose example would you like to follow, and why?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Václav Havel. Justice Ginsburg for her lifelong dedication to equality before the law for women and all marginalized people. Havel for his lifelong commitment to truth, individual freedom, democracy, transparency, and peace.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Is there a book, essay, film, or something else you would recommend to someone who wants to understand your political philosophy?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Not necessary about political philosophy, but Leonardo DiCaprio’s Ice on Fire documentary delivers an urgent message for bold climate action.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What characteristics or principles are most important for an elected official?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Integrity, compassion, courage, persistence, and thoughtfulness.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What qualities do you possess that you believe would make you a successful officeholder?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I can not be bullied or bought. I think strategically and am able to commit to a long fight for justice.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What do you believe are the core responsibilities for someone elected to this office?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">To prioritize the interests of the people over corporations, to provide oversight of the executive branch, and to pursue legislation that leads to social, racial, economic, and environmental justice.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What legacy would you like to leave?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Where healthcare is a right and not a privilege, college education is tuition free, women are equal, immigrants are welcome, Indigenous people are truly sovereign, our planet is protected, and people can live their true identity without fear of discrimination.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What is the first historical event that happened in your lifetime that you remember? How old were you at the time?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I was born and raised in Slovakia - formerly Czechoslovakia. I was 12 years old when massive public demonstrations against the totalitarian regime tore down the Iron Curtain and resulted in the birth of political democracy. The peaceful “Velvet Revolution” formed me as a person and my belief that when people organize, when they march, when they stand in solidarity with each other, they can transform their communities for the better.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What qualities does the U.S. House of Representatives possess that makes it unique as an institution?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">The House of Representatives is known as “The People’s House” for a good reason. Each congressional district has approximately 750,000 people in it. It is the branch of government most conducive to intimate contact between the representative and their constituents. All revenue bills originate in the House, and Impeachment proceedings as well.  

Right now, the House is not reflective of the population in age, gender, or race. We need a House that looks like the people it serves if we want it to represent and understand those people.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Do you believe that it's beneficial for representatives to have previous experience in government or politics?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">It’s beneficial but not necessary. Experience may help, but it’s based on the individual. We’ve seen people who are serving their first term in public office and are moving mountains. On the other hand, some spent decades in public office and haven’t done anything to better the lives of their constituents.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What do you perceive to be the United States’ greatest challenges as a nation over the next decade?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Reversing climate change must be a top priority and massive investments must be made in an equitable way, not leaving communities of color and other marginalized people behind. Climate change is an economic issue, a health issue, a national security issue, an immigration issue—it’s everything.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">If you are not a current representative, are there certain committees that you would want to be a part of?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I would want to be on Ways and Means, Homeland Security, Education and Labor, and the Select Committee on Climate Crisis.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Do you believe that two years is the right term length for representatives?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I believe four-year cycles and a three terms limit would be better.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What are your thoughts on term limits?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I support term limits coupled with expanding voting rights to ensure citizens are engaged and there is a pipeline of quality representatives.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What process do you favor for redistricting?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I favor independent redistricting commissions like we have in Arizona.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">If you are not currently a member of your party’s leadership in the U.S. House of Representatives, would you be interested in joining the leadership? If so, in what role?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I would like to become the Chair of the DCCC so we can bring democracy into the Democratic party. We need to stop the heavy-handed undemocratic way the party distributes its power to favor some candidates while undermining others in primaries. We need a party that is fueled by people, not corporate money.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Is there a particular representative, past or present, whom you want to model yourself after?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">From long-serving members, I would model myself after Rep. Barbara Lee, who had the courage to cast the only vote in opposition to giving the President the Authorization to Use Military Force against any nation, group or persons who planned and initiated the attacks on 9/11. This vague resolution which passed the House 420 to 1, has resulted in America’s never ending military intervention in the affairs of seven nations to date with little to no congressional oversight. Rep. Lee was right to oppose the AUMF in 2001 and the rest of Congress was wrong. She is a singular profile in courage and I aspire to be like her when I am elected.

From the newer members, I admire Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Rep. Ayanna Pressley, Rep. Ilhan Omar, Rep. Rashida Tlaib, Rep. Ro Khanna, and Rep. Pramila Jayapal. They are all bold leaders with an ambitious vision for our country. They aren’t afraid to speak up when faced with hate and continue to introduce bold, meaningful legislation that puts people first.</p>

The problems facing hardworking people in this country are not impossible to solve. The challenges of moving this country toward one that is equitable and just is not an insurmountable task.

				<p class=""survey-response"">I am a big supporter of term limits in both chambers of Congress. We have career politicians who park themselves in the halls of Congress and feel safe because of backroom redistricting and partisan gerrymandering and that isn't right, in fact I believe its anathema to democracy. We have an entire cadre of elected officials that are more interested in keeping their jobs when they should be prioritizing doing their jobs</p>

					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What process do you favor for redistricting?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">A fully open and transparent one. Redistricting is a crucial avenue by which undeserved and underrepresented communities can gain meaningful representation.

					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Both sitting representatives and candidates for office hear many personal stories from the residents of their district. Is there a story that you’ve heard that you found particularly touching, memorable, or impactful?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I was campaigning in my district and after a long day on my feet I stooped in a local sandwich shop to grab a quick bite to eat. There was this older women sitting across the restaurant from me and she kept staring at me as I was having a phone conversation with a member of my campaign team about housing policy. The woman walked over to my table and sat down and struck up a conversation with me. As we were talking it was clear to me that she was homeless and that she was sitting in the sandwich shop to get out of the weather. I asked her had she had anything to eat today and suddenly tears began to well up in her eyes. Ill never forget what she said next: ""I like you because you didn't judge me,"" she said no she had not eaten that day so I purchased a few sandwiches and bags of chips for her. That really hit me, this was someone's child, she has a story, she deserves respect and love just as we all do. I couldn't for one second imagine myself ever judging her or anybody else that was in her position, but the fact that she expected to be judged and castigated and shunned by her fellow man saddens me. As long as I live I will never forget that encounter and when I'm tired and down and hurting I look back to it as motivation to keep fighting for people like Mary who don't have anybody to fight for them.</p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">Who are you? Tell us about yourself in 300 words or less.</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">My name is Heerak Christian Kim, and I immigrated to the United States, when my father received a call to be the Senior Pastor of the First Korean Presbyterian Church in Philadelphia. My Korean name, Heerak, means ""joy"" and is the second fruit of the Holy Spirit in Galatians 5:22. I attended Phil-Mont Christian Academy for my elementary, middle, and high school education and learned the value of Christian ethics for creating a decent and moral society. I believe in the American Dream and worked hard to achieve many wonderful things. I received full scholarship as the Philadelphia Mayor's Scholar at the University of Pennslyvania, and garduated cum Laude with a major in history and a minor in classical studies. At the age of 19, I was accepted to the Ph.D. program in history at UCLA and concurrently accepted to Fuller Theological Seminary for the M.Div. program. I pursued both programs concurrently in the Los Angeles area. I started Student For Christ (SFC) college Bible study group at UCLA. Currently, I am an expert in Jewish studies with a professional membership in the Association for Jewish Studies (AJS). I am also a licensed teacher in Virginia, District of Columbia, Alabama, Tennesee, and South Carolina. I have worked as Certified Nurse Aide (CNA) in Delaware and Virginia. I am currently working on my Master of Science in Nursing (MSN) at Georgetown University. I will use all of my skills to solve our nation's most pressing problems in healthcare, education, and ethics.</p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">Please list below 3 key messages of your campaign. What are the main points you want voters to remember about your goals for your time in office?</p>
				<ul class=""key-messages"">
					<li>Improving America's public school education will contribute to America having better employed workforce, good citizens who contribute to society, and great parents who raise amazing children and create wonderful communities.</li>
					<li>Obamacare has given us higher insurance premimum and sky-high deductibles that American citizens cannot afford. I will replace Obamacare with a practical insurance that actually works and does not impoverish the American working class.</li>
					<li>It is a great shame that so many US veterans are becoming homeless and suffering.  I will create infrastructure reforms that will help US Veterns to be happy and to receive the services that they need to thrive after active duty.</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
							<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What areas of public policy are you personally passionate about?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I am personally passionate about public school education. I am a firm believer that we can improve public school education to serve the needs of the American people, effectively. Children are in school most of the day throughout the week. It is in this context, we can focus on helping the children receive the education that they need to be contributing members of society. Many recent mass shootings in public schools have been perpetrated by products of America's public school education, who felt themselves to be disenfranchised in their own country and struggling for employment. The way to solve gun violence in society is not to limit the sale of guns. Gun ownership is a US Constitutional right. The way to solve the problem of mass shootings in schools and other public areas is to provide the kind of education that can help America's children attending public schools every day to learn to love themselves and others. I believe that we need to bring Christian ethics that emphasize loving others and being kind back into the public school system. Currently, there are a lot of unnecessary energy spent on transgender and gay rights education in America's public schools, which are confusing the children and contributing to the grwoth of gender dysphoria and self-harm, including successful suicides. To a certain extent, current opposition to Christian values and forced brainwashing in gay rights and transgender education in public schools are contributing forces to mass gun violence.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Who do you look up to? Whose example would you like to follow, and why?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I look up to my father, who is a Korean Presbyterian clergy.  My father, Rev. Manwoo Kim, served as the Senior Pastor of First Korean Presbyterian Church in Philadelphia from the first day of his immigration to the United States until his retirement several decades later.  During this time, my father served as the father of all the church members, being there to comfort the children whose father was shot to death while working as a shopt owner in the city of Philadelphia during armed robbery.  He was there to help Korean families whether familial conflicts.  It was because of his excellent pastoral ministry that there was no divorce in the church during several decades of his pastoral ministry.  Parents who had contemplated divorce are very grateful that my father provided the kind of Christian leadership that helped their family to stay, together.  His dedication to Christian families is not so common in modern day America, where many Christian pastors give up too easily, resultign in many couples in the church getting divorced and regretting later.</p>

					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What is the first historical event that happened in your lifetime that you remember? How old were you at the time?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">The first traumatic historical event that happened during my lifetime was the Los Angeles Riots, when I was pursuing my Ph.D. in history at UCLA and M.Div. at Fuller Theological Seminary, concurrently.  I had founded the Student For Christ (SFC) Bible study at UCLA, and it had grown from zero students to over 80 students, most of whom were ethnic Koreans.  As their Bible study leader, I had to comfort my Korean students, some of whom witnessed their parents' store being attacked on TV. Many of them thanked God for the Second Amendment of the US Constitution that allowed their parents to own guns to defend themselves when many police officers were refusing to go into Koreatown in Los Angeles to rescue Korean shopowners because it was very dangerous at that time even for police officers.  I was in my early twenties and realized the importance of Nantional Rifle Association (NRA) in helping Americans protect themselves in unpredictable traumatic historical events.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What was your very first job? How long did you have it?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">My very first job was as English Ministries (EM) Pastor at a Korean church in the Koreatown area of Los Angeles.  I served in this capacity for one year while pursuing my Ph.D. studies in historyat UCLA and M.Div. at Fuller Theological Seminary,  concurrently, at the age of 20.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What is your favorite book? Why?</p>

			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What qualities does the U.S. House of Representatives possess that makes it unique as an institution?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">U.S. House of Representatives can create laws that are righteous, just, fair, and moral in order to help families and individuals to thrive and to build wholesome communities based on Christian moral principles that are beneficial to the society and represent \""The Common Good\"".</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Do you believe that it's beneficial for representatives to have previous experience in government or politics?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I think experience in government can be beneficial as long as the representative does not become jaded and complacent and compromising in his or her Christian value system to create a just, fair, and moral society for Americans.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What do you perceive to be the United States’ greatest challenges as a nation over the next decade?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">The greatest challenge for the United States as a nation over the next decade is immorality.  Roman democracy and Greek democracy in history have shown that immorality as represented by rampant and public support for homosexuality and transgenderism results in complete society breakdown and destruction of the nation.  Turning the United States toward a moral direction of supporting a wholesome family is the key to the survival of the United States as a nation, given the facts from history.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">If you are not a current representative, are there certain committees that you would want to be a part of?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">(1) United States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform
(2) The Committee on Education and Labor 
(3) Committee on Veterans' Affairs
(4) Committee on Foreign Affairs</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Do you believe that two years is the right term length for representatives?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Yes</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What are your thoughts on term limits?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Term limits can be a serious problem for good US Congressmen who can make a positive difference and maintain stability.  My father being able to serve as the Senior Pastor for decades allowed effective community building and continuity of good programs initiated by my father.  Good congressmen can provide long-term growth by providing continuity of leadership.</p>

					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Is there a particular representative, past or present, whom you want to model yourself after?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Newton Leroy Gingrich</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Both sitting representatives and candidates for office hear many personal stories from the residents of their district. Is there a story that you’ve heard that you found particularly touching, memorable, or impactful?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I have spoken with parents who have children in the public schools in Virginia 8th District who are really worried about sex education at the elementary/middle school levels that justify homosexuality and transgenderism.  Christian parents deeply oppose the gay life style based on their Christian faith and teachings of the Bible, and they said that they had to pull their children out of public schools and put them in costly private schools that will not engage in (what they call) indocrination in gay marriage and transgenderism.  One US Marshall, livingin Arlington, who is Puerto Rican American, said that his love for his child prompted him to do this. Another Christian parent said that she wanted to pull her children out of public schools in the area for the same reasons but could not afford to do so.  I realized that public schools in Virginia 8th District are engaging in activites that worry many parents in the area, even those who are not particularly religious.  These parents said that they are going to vote for me and support me in bringing Christian morality and ethics to local public schools. I felt touched and moved by their support. </p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">Who are you? Tell us about yourself in 300 words or less.</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">My name is Ryan Tate. I was born in Bremerton, Washington and graduated from the University of Puget Sound in 2011 with B.A. degrees in International Political Economy and International Business with a minor in Chinese. I am married and live with my wife, Kelsey, in Tacoma's McKinley-Hilltop district for the past 5 years. I currently work as a senior software engineer for a financial technology startup writing software for commercial and central banks. My experience writing software for banks has provided me with insights into the structure of our banking sector and the inefficiencies therein. One of my key policies if elected will be to reform our banking sector, starting with the prioritization of a new Federal Reserve payments and settlement system (FedNow), which I believe will provide the U.S. Federal Reserve new monetary policy tools to stimulate our economy and distribute capital directly to our productivity segments, such as small businesses. By focusing on our monetary policy mechanisms, the U.S. has more tools to responsibly manage our fiscal spending for vital programs our country needs. These programs include student loan reform, housing stimulus, small business lending, balance of payment imbalances (i.e. trade deficit with China), infrastructure expenditures, and much more. By focusing on our sovereign debt and credit markets, we have much greater control over our fiscal expenditures, risk management and taxation policies. Long Live America, Long Live Democracy!</p>
			</div>
						    <div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Please list below 3 key messages of your campaign. What are the main points you want voters to remember about your goals for your time in office?</p>
				<ul class=""key-messages"">
					<li>The U.S. Federal Reserve is falling behind our foreign counterparts in technological solutions. Banking sector reform is vital to bring greater efficiencies to our domestic capital markets, and ensure our sovereign debt markets remain strong and the U.S. dollar remains as the reserve currency of the world.</li>
					<li>Our balance of payments and trade deficits with our foreign neighbors cannot be solved solely by trade agreements using tariffs. Monetary policy action is required to ensure our economy is able to compete in the global market, whereby other foreign powers (e.g. China) have historically had closed capital accounts to debt markets, keeping their export goods relatively cheap compared to more open economies.</li>
					<li>The federal minimum wage needs to be increased. Currently, the states with minimum wages at the federal level ($7.25/hr) have the highest poverty rates in the country. Germany, Japan and the U.K. all have hourly wages at the equivalent of $9/hr. Corporations were given a 14% tax cut with the expectation that they would increase wages. Instead, they repurchased stock. Net profits (after tax) of all U.S. companies in 2019 is on-course to be around $8 trillion. U.S. companies have the ability to pay their employees a living wage, and we must demand this to ensure our payroll taxes that fund Social Security benefits are able to meet the demographic demands in the next 20 years.</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
							<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What areas of public policy are you personally passionate about?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I am most passionate about our economic public policies, both monetary and fiscal policies, which I believe have significant impact in the other areas of public policy. This includes the tax revenues collected, and the expenditures the government makes on health care, infrastructure, education and more. I believe the U.S. economy is the largest economy in the world due to its mixed-market structure. While imperfect, I believe capitalism and free markets are the best allocators of capital in the long-run. However, I also believe that the government has a role to play in ensuring that profiteering does not run rampant to the point that the middle class in unable to earn a living wage and pay for basic needs. By setting the boundaries and rules to the market, such that we can avoid the pitfalls of other lessons learned in history, the U.S. can continue to grow and beat our expectations for what we believe is possible. The course of the U.S. economy depends upon the passing of legislation that sets aside partisan beliefs and focuses on the solutions that will drive our economy forward. Many individuals want progressive policy reforms, but the questions often come down to, \""how do we pay for it?\"" or \""who will administer it?\"". It is at this juncture that policy solutions are needed. We need better cooperation with private industry in the government, more fiscal responsibility by our governments and we need to prove that the government can effectively administer these policies.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Is there a book, essay, film, or something else you would recommend to someone who wants to understand your political philosophy?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I would recommend Milton and Rose Friedman's 1980 \""Free to Choose: A Personal Statement\"" for better understanding my political philosophies. Friedman's main argument is that free markets and limits of government interference leads to the best outcomes for a nation's prosperity. I generally agree with this principle. I generally agree that too much government regulation and interference leads to misallocations and lost opportunities. However, like Friedman, I also recognize that there is some role of government. One of my most controversial arguments is that we need to raise the federal minimum wage to $20 per hour. Most people I share this position with find it unbearable, despite annual net profits of U.S. corporations reaching in excess of $8 trillion in the last decade. Yet, when observing the states that do not have a higher minimum wage greater than the federal limit, we find that those states are among our nations most impoverished. Friedman's concern with an ever larger and overbearing government was the inevitable collusion of government and industry that lead to inefficiencies, in which government needed ever more regulation to circumvent. This cycle occurs ad nauseam to a degree in which the government continues to spend more to regulate more, all the while failing to fix our fundamental problems that gave rise to the original problem. A smaller government allows the market to find a natural equilibrium. Now, the challenge we face today is that we're in an ever more globally connected world competing in markets that have raced to the bottom, where the workers of those countries may have no other choice but to work below living standards. In good faith, I can't make the argument that the government has not contributed to the net increase in living standards, however, in the meanwhile I do question whether the U.S. has remained as competitive as our foreign counter parts who have embraced free market principles. I recommend Friedman as a thoughtful read.</p>

					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What qualities do you possess that you believe would make you a successful officeholder?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I am a student of the great recession. I entered the University of Puget Sound in 2007 declaring my major in International Political Economy, International Business and Chinese. The following year I remember sitting in an economics class and hearing the news that Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy, triggering the beginning of the global financial crises. 

It shifted my focus from legal studies into our banking sector, financial markets and monetary policy. In 2009, I studied abroad in China and witnessed a different economic miracle taking place and compared China's political-economic system to the United States'. Nearly ten years later, we are witnessing the trends I had bear witness to then take precedence in our foreign policy and economic markets today. 

I believe my educational studies, work experience as an investment analyst in emerging markets and my skillset as a software engineer in financial services uniquely provide me the analytical problem solving qualities needed to be a successful representative in perspective of the contemporary challenges our Union faces today and solutions our country needs for tomorrow's prosperity.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What legacy would you like to leave?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I would like to return our country back to a balanced federal budget, in which our future economic prosperity is not compromised by the government spending of today. As I mentioned previously, ~8% of our federal expenditures is spent on servicing interest on previously issued government debt to make up the difference in government spending and revenue shortfalls collected from taxes in the past. If I were able to help draft and pass legislation that would introduce new mechanisms for distributing and managing government benefits which reduce the bureaucratic inefficiencies in our current system and utilize more of our current tax revenue, that would be an excellent legacy. As a software engineer who has used our governmental systems and worked on systems for Fortune 10 companies, I am positive we can develop far better processes to our federal systems. I am also positive we can develop new markets to incentivize private industry to contribute and invest more in the development of America.</p>

					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What was your very first job? How long did you have it?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">While at Rancho Buena Vista High School in Vista, CA, I had the opportunity to intern for California State Assemblyman Mark Wyland and U.S. Congressman Darrell Issa during the school year. It was Congressman Issa who encouraged me to study Mandarin Chinese and piqued my interest in federal politics. During this period, I started studying Mandarin Chinese at night classes at Palomar Community College while still in high school. After graduation I attended the University of Puget Sound, pursuing a degree in international political economy, international business and a minor in Chinese. In 2009, I traveled to Taiwan and China to continue my studies in Mandarin and eventually wrote my senior thesis on China's informal credit markets and banking sector. When I returned from studying abroad in China and while a senior at the University of Puget Sound, I was accepted as an intern at Russell Investments in Seattle, WA to their Global Index reconstitution team, evaluating Chinese and Southeast Asian company financial reports for their global index weighting. When I graduated in 2011, I went to work for George Russell's private family office, Threshold Group in Gig Harbor, WA, as an investment analyst covering asset managers in the emerging markets. While at Threshold Group, I oversaw roughly $300 million assets under management managed by emerging market asset managers. Threshold Group was technically my first professional job, and it had a profound impact on my understanding of global financial markets. It was also special since George Russell helped grow Russell Investments into a billion dollar company and was a major influencer in emerging markets through the Russell 20-20 program. I worked at Threshold Group for 1 year and 4 months before transitioning my focus toward financial technology and software, which I currently work as a senior software engineer for M10 Networks, Inc. writing commercial and central bank software.</p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">What qualities does the U.S. House of Representatives possess that makes it unique as an institution?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">The U.S. House of Representatives determines the discretionary spending of the federal budget and introduces legislation that will help enact policies that would enable the federal government to balance the budget. These powers come with great responsibilities, and it makes the U.S. House of Representatives a unique institution among our federal, state and local governments. Roughly 55% of all government spending is spent by the federal government. Ensuring that we elect representatives that understand the context and duties of the office is important so we do not pass legislation that further increases our budget deficit. If we elect representatives who believe the debt ceiling or budget deficit does not matter, I am concerned that those decisions will result in a future scenario where our government is unable to pay its debt obligations and will end up destroying the trust in and demand of our government bonds. If this were to happen, it would result in the U.S. dollar no longer being held as the global reserve currency and would significantly impair our economic position in the world.</p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">What do you perceive to be the United States’ greatest challenges as a nation over the next decade?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">The United States federal government spent $363 billion (roughly 7.9% of the total budget) servicing the interest on our sovereign debt in the 2019 fiscal year. The debt issued is a result of our federal government running a budget deficit, meaning that it is spending more money than it is collecting through tax revenue. It is expected that before 2030, the amount of interest paid on government debt will double. While the U.S. Federal Reserve is the single largest holder of U.S. Treasury Bonds, foreign governments and pensions also purchase our Treasury Bonds. The U.S. sovereign debt market is the largest sovereign debt market in the world and many institutions consider it to be one of the safest markets in the world, as the U.S. government has never defaulted on its debt obligations. The concern, however, is given the amount of spending that is required to sustain and stimulate our economy, how will the U.S. federal government be able to afford the costs of our mandatory and discretionary projects while not increasing our budget deficit. The U.S. government has significant expenditures it will need to make over the next two decades (e.g. $5 trillion on upgrading our energy grid), and it will require spending and taxation reform to balance our federal budget. It will require monetary policy action that works in conjunction with fiscal policies, and not against. Meanwhile, we need to ensure our economy remains competitive in the global market and our debt markets remain solvent. Reducing the amount the federal government spends on servicing the interest on our treasury bonds will redirect that spending to vital areas of our economy. But this can only be achieved through a balance budget, less we run the risk of issuing more debt to pay for the interest on previous issued debt. This scenario will lead to the a spiraling of our federal spending and will balloon the money supply to pay for yesterday's expenditures at the expense of tomorrow's future.</p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">If you are not a current representative, are there certain committees that you would want to be a part of?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Despite a representative only being able to serve on two committees, there are a few committees I would have interest being a member of. My first two priorities would be on the \""Budget\"" and \""Financial Services\"" committees. While each committee is important to the state of our Union, I believe that these two committees would allow me to best serve our nation to write legislation that for what I view as our nation's most fundamental challenges.  After these committees, my main interests would include the following committees: \""Energy and Commerce\"", \""Foreign Affairs\"", \""Science, Space and Technology\"", \""Small Business\"" and \""Transportation and Infrastructure\"". I am also interested in serving on the \""Economic\"" and \""Taxation\"" Joint committees.</p>

				<p class=""survey-response"">Andy has run an independent financial advisory and insurance practice since 1998. He has worked in several cycles as a volunteer for Republican presidential and congressional candidates. 

After watching Congressman Brian Fitzpatrick fail his constituents over and over again by voting like a Pelosi Democrat and opposing President Trump, even going so far to label him a ""racist"", Andy felt it was imperative that an actual Republican challenge Fitzpatrick for his house seat. A passionate and energetic advocate for classic conservative American values and the Trump presidency, Andy will be on the ballot for the Republican primary April 28th, 2020 in Pennsylvania's First Congressional District.

				<p class=""survey-question"">Who are you? Tell us about yourself in 300 words or less.</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Rachel Ventura is a mathematician, a naturalist, a Will County Board member and a single mother raising twin girls. She grew up in Joliet, IL with two working class, extremely political parents, both union members. She knows the power of organizing people for a stronger voice.

Ventura skipped a grade in high school, graduated with a Bachelors degree in Mathematics from Benedictine University, and later earned a second degree in Biology. She left a successful career as an actuary in the insurance industry because she saw the injustices that the industry created in our society. She became a naturalist working for the Georgia State Parks.

In 2016, Ventura left an abusive marriage and returned to Joliet. She was outraged at the condition of the city she grew up in, the rampant corruption and abuse of power in city hall. Coming from a political family, she was encouraged to do something about it. 

She ran with the tagline, ""no strings attached."" She had a strong showing in a field of 15 candidates for city council and turned around to run for the Will County Board. She dominated the 5-person primary and won the general election by 8% points over the Republican and 11% over the other Democrat. She has continued to challenge the corrupt system and win the support of the people.</p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">What qualities do you possess that you believe would make you a successful officeholder?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I moved quickly on the Will County Board to successfully push for the Greenest Region Compact, a framework for regional sustainability.  I listened to residents of the 9th district when they raised concerns about Aqua a private water company that was being contracted to take over Fairmont's water.

					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What do you believe are the core responsibilities for someone elected to this office?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Every elected official should be responsive to their constituents, listen to their concerns and act on behalf of the majority of residents in that district. If every lawmaker did this and closed the door on the wealthy corporate lobbyists who buy access to the decision makers, we would have a government that works for everyone. An elected official should be honest and courageous enough to challenge friends and foes alike when things are not going in a direction that benefits the majority of Americans.</p>

			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What do you perceive to be the United States’ greatest challenges as a nation over the next decade?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">The greatest threat to all people all over the world is the climate crisis. I support the Green New Deal as the most viable solution to move out of crisis state. Unfortunately, we have a political system that allows the fossil fuel industry to buy off lawmakers and water down legislation so pseudo solutions like the USE IT ACT are being discussed instead of the Green New Deal. Ending the corrupting influence of money on our political system seems to be an equally important step.</p>

			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Do you believe that two years is the right term length for representatives?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Two, or four-year terms seems appropriate. It is difficult to accomplish something in two years while one is perpetually campaigning. A hybrid solution might be to have a 2-year term and then a 4-year term, followed by another 2-year term.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What are your thoughts on term limits?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Although I see the appeal of term limits since we have a broken system where too many politicians are listening to their wealthy donors and not their constituents, I don't feel that setting rules like term limits is the best solution. The American people have the ability to vote out their representative every two years or keep them in. Term limits doesn't turn over staff, it doesn't present the moving up into higher office, it doesn't stop the revolving lobbyist door, it doesn't allow someone good to do their best for the time needed, and it takes the ability of the people to choose away. Instead we need campaign finance reform and an end to Citizen's United. We need to remove barriers to voting and allow for more mail in voting or early voting.   </p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">If you are not currently a member of your party’s leadership in the U.S. House of Representatives, would you be interested in joining the leadership? If so, in what role?</p>

I would prefer to support someone else whom I agree with philosophically during my first term, but I feel ready to lead on issues related to energy and the environment.</p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">Both sitting representatives and candidates for office hear many personal stories from the residents of their district. Is there a story that you’ve heard that you found particularly touching, memorable, or impactful?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Wendy shared a disturbing, sad story about her 38-year old cousin, Nick, who was diagnosed with a hernia. The simple laparoscopic surgery to fix the hernia was not covered by his for-profit insurance company. The company denied the claim stating that it was not medically necessary. On October 22nd, Nick went home sick and started bleeding. He tried controlling the bleeding with towels and sheets, but it was not enough. Because his insurance company had denied Nick the care he needed to repair the hernia, he bled to death, and was discovered in his home 48 hours later.</p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">What would be your top three priorities, if elected?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Economy, education and immigration:

Economy. The American economy has left working families behind and is one of the most important issues in this election. I Every day, I fight for policies and programs that will create good-paying jobs and economic opportunity for the people of Arizona's third congressional district.. Arizona's working families are tired of seeing their wages stagnate while watching the rich getting richer. .CEOs are taking home upwards of 300 times that of the typical worker,  while working families live paycheck-to-paycheck, get by with less and less, and work longer hours. Just this past year, Republicans in Congress passed a tax plan that prioritized the interests of the wealthy and big corporations over working families, and now--they are looking to pay for them by cutting your Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. I will not let this happen.

To strengthen our economy, it's time we invest in our communities and workers. e need to raise the minimum wage, provide paid sick and parental leave, ensure affordable child care, and offer debt-free college to allow families to save more of their money. We need to put Americans back to work with good-paying jobs that ensure stronger collective bargaining rights, end wage theft,  and stop the abuse of unpaid overtime hours. We need to protect and expand Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid--not make debilitating cuts to them. We can fund these investments by ending the Trump tax cuts for the wealthy and corporations and ensuring that they pay their fair share.

Education
All kids, regardless of their zip code, deserve access to quality schools, and public schools and teachers must be equipped with the resources they need to give our students an excellent education. As we've seen with teacher-led protests around the country--including in Arizona--teachers and educational professionals need support to ensure they can enable student success. Outdated textbooks, crumbling school buildings and stagnant salaries are the results of Republican policies at the state and national level that have gutted school funding and left our teachers to make miracles with few resources. I've consistently fought for more school funding, greater accountability, and better resources to ensure that our students get the best education possible from K-12 and beyond.

WIth student debt spiraling out of control and higher education becoming less affordable, attending college is not longer a reality for individuals across the country. In Congress, I will continue to prioritize access to higher education opportunities and support proposals that tackle the student debt crisis, increase affordability, and prevent predatory for-profit institutions from preying on vulnerable students. It's time for Congress to start prioritizing education and invest in the future of our country.

Immigration
We are a nation of laws and a nation of immigrants, and we need to reconcile those facts. Republicans continue to block comprehensive immigration reform and offer unrealistic threats in its place, including the horrific policy of separating children from their parents.

Those of us who live and work on the border appreciate its uniqueness and know it remains a safe place.  We should not vilify people who are seeking a better life but focus on human traffickers and drug smuggling cartels who actually pose a threat.

Trump's border wall would waste billions in taxpayer money, cause irreparable environmental damage, and further divide families and sovereign tribal nations.
It is absurd to think that we can simply deport every undocumented person. It would wreak havoc on our economy, in addition to the enormous human toll of asking 12 million people to abandon their livelihoods. Instead, a more practical solution is to allow them to apply for permanent residency with a pathway to citizenship, that includes paying a fee.  A recent report from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) found that comprehensive immigration reform would reduce the federal budget deficit by $197 billion over the next decade and $700 billion over the next 20 years. Comprehensive immigration reform will build a stronger society and economy. The time for reform is now.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What areas of public policy are you personally passionate about?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Climate change is an existential crisis for our planet, not a question of personal opinion.  The science is clear. Our climate is getting warmer in large part because carbon and methane emissions have changed the way our planet behaves. The oil and gas industry has spent decades and many millions of dollars trying to convince the American people not to take action. Unfortunately that dishonest campaign has succeeded in Congress and the Trump administration, even where it's failed with public opinion. We need to increase support for renewable energy -- particularly solar in hotspots like Arizona and the Southwest -- and put a tax on every ton of carbon emitted by industrial sources. The last thing we need is to keep waiting or pretending there's a scientific debate. The scientific debate ended a long time ago. The political debate has done nothing but paralyze our government, delay needed action, and put our communities at risk.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Who do you look up to? Whose example would you like to follow, and why?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Robert F. Kennedy was, and continues to be, a source of inspiration to me and my career in public service. His untimely assassination changed our history, and we're left with unanswered questions and unrealized aspirations about what could have been. One's politics are never static. They change with us as we go through new experiences, meet new people, and experience periods of personal growth. When Kennedy changed as a person, his politics reflected this. He was both inspirational and aspirational. He worked for the poor, pushed for a more equitable society, and sought tolerance and racial reconciliation. Unfortunately, our current political reality is quite the opposite. The ideals that Kennedy worked hard to embody are viewed as signs of weakness by the current administration. Values like tolerance, dignity, and a general desire to do what's best for the American people are in short supply in the current White House. Kennedy represents the true strength of political leadership and the enduring need to do what's right, not what's politically expedient. As Kennedy once said, ""The future is not completely beyond our control. It is the work of our own hands."" Each day that I'm in Congress, I recognize this responsibility and do everything in my power to create a better future for America's children and grandchildren.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What characteristics or principles are most important for an elected official?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Bravery and sincerity are more important in politics than many people realize. You can make more of a difference by speaking the truth you believe in -- despite powerful establishment opposition -- than by saying what you think everyone wants to hear. I stand by my principles and take a clear stance on issues impacting Arizonans.Serving the voters means taking real positions on real pieces of legislation, not hiding behind generalities.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What qualities do you possess that you believe would make you a successful officeholder?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">The ability to compromise and the ability to organize without losing out on your priorities is an important quality. When I joined Congress in early 2003, former Speaker of the House John Boehner was chairman of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce. I worked with him to expand Head Start for Native American communities and to increase resources for the Migrant Head Start program. That process taught me, early in my congressional career, that real compromise means give and take on both sides, no matter who's in the majority or minority on a given day. Expecting the minority to give everything and get nothing in return is not a compromise, and it doesn't build trust for the next negotiation. Getting things done in Congress is impossible when force and a bare majority are the only things that matter. That's the system we have today. The American people would think a lot more of Congress if we started treating compromise as a serious option rather than as a surrender. It's also important to make politics local, by making sure people at the community level fully understand the repercussions of the policies in Washington, including who is standing on which side of a debate. I'm willing to take a stand on difficult issues and to help people engage around the issues, so that they speak together as a powerful voice to make sure their best interests are being represented.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What do you believe are the core responsibilities for someone elected to this office?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">The core responsibility of someone elected to this office is to serve the people and legislate according to their best interests. I have a proven record of helping Arizona's economy, protecting Arizona's environment, and standing up for Arizona's working families. I have fought, and continue to fight, for comprehensive immigration reform and an end to the militarization of our borders. I was shaped by and continue to uphold the best values of our community: environmental and historical conservation, cultural diversity, fair treatment for everyone, and respect for our history. Those values have compelled me to support stronger environmental standards, a higher minimum wage, comprehensive immigration reform, an end to the militarization of our borders, and an expansion of the social safety net that supports people in need. Arizona sets a high standard for treating other people well and supporting the community. I'm honored to meet that standard as a public servant.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What is your favorite book? Why?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">My current favorite book is ""Robert F. Kennedy: The Making of a Liberal Icon"" by Larry Tye. I remain impressed, even decades later, by the way Robert Kennedy energized people from all walks of life to believe in a real, positive, achievable vision of a better future. Many leaders have a single skill that helps them get things done: they know how to connect with people, or they have great organizational skills, or they have a compelling set of values that mean a great deal to the people they encounter. Robert Kennedy had each of those qualities and many more, and the story of his life remains compelling to me and to everyone who believes in public service. This biography tells that story in a rare way that shows his qualities in human terms, not just in political terms. I hope more people read it. It's a true inspiration.</p>

				<p class=""survey-response"">As Ranking Member of the Natural Resources Committee, I lead the fight to address climate change, hold polluters accountable and preserve our public lands.

As a member of the Committee on Education and The Workforce, I fight to provide needed resources and equity to our faltering education system and make access to debt-free higher education a reality for all.</p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">Is there a particular representative, past or present, whom you want to model yourself after?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I have always greatly admired Mo Udall. His advocacy for the environment, especially here in Arizona, had a formative effect on my own political views, and I consider it a great responsibility to live up to his conservation legacy. His support for social justice and his willingness to speak his mind, even when he was in the political minority, were important touchstones for Arizonans of all political persuasions during his career and remain important today. His wit, friendliness and humanity -- even in the midst of vital political battles -- have always been a reminder that public servants can't succeed without maintaining relationships and keeping perspective. His achievements have helped guide my own efforts to conserve Arizona's natural places and to uplift the Southern Arizona community.</p>

				<ul class=""key-messages"">
					<li>American Democracy is broken: together we can fix it. The two party system is crippling America, and we must implement governmental voting reform. </li>
					<li>The American worker is forgotten. Our movement believes in working class empowerment: this means that we must demand universal healthcare, a living wage, and end the corporate greed that is destroying the fabric of American society. </li>
					<li>Environmental sustainability is the issue of our generation and future generations. If we do not have radical change in regards to our environmental policy, millions will die. </li>

							<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What areas of public policy are you personally passionate about?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Without a proper electoral system, we cannot have a discourse. The average American is usually an afterthought to corporate and elite interests. Electoral and government reform subordinate all other causes. </p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">Who are you? Tell us about yourself in 300 words or less.</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I am an Independent candidate because I believe a representative should answer to their constituents not a political party. It's time we unite and tackle the many non-partisan issues we face everyday.</p>

							<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What areas of public policy are you personally passionate about?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Arkansas is one of the poorest states in America, ranking 49 in terms of lowest income. At the same time, we pay the highest taxes in the nation. Something is very wrong. Our representatives have failed to tackle these issues for decades, and the time has come to finally address these two very important issues. These issues cross party lines and it's going to take us coming together, as Arkansans in whole, to overcome these obstacles. We need representatives that listen to us, that understand the struggles we face every day. When 67% of children born in Arkansas are covered by Medicaid, our representatives have no business voting time and time again to cut Medicaid.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Who do you look up to? Whose example would you like to follow, and why?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Something happened to me in 2015, Bernie Sanders woke me up. He showed me the corruption in our government. He showed me how our legislators take huge sums of money from special interest donors in exchange for favorable legislation that in return hurts their constituents and their families. He showed me how so many Americans are suffering, while the richest 1% hoard nearly all the wealth gained. HE SHOWED ME how corporations can use tax evasion loopholes to pay $0 in taxes, while the rest of us are stuck footing the bill by paying 20-30% in taxes. Bernie Sanders and I may not agree on everything, but he showed me what I needed to see, what I need to show everyone who hasn't seen these things yet. Bernie Sanders started a political revolution, one that will put the American government back into the hands of the people where it belongs. It's up to us to continue this movement. It's up to us to take on the special interest donors that have purchased our government and tell them ENOUGH IS ENOUGH!</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Is there a book, essay, film, or something else you would recommend to someone who wants to understand your political philosophy?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">A big motivator in my decision to run for office was the movie Mr. Smith Goes to Washington. That is what I strive to be, a representative my constituents will be proud of, a man my country will be proud of, a father my daughter will be proud of.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What characteristics or principles are most important for an elected official?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Honesty, transparency, and integrity. When I say I am sick and tired of politicians lying to my face I know I am not alone. I am tired of hearing a candidate make all sorts of promises, then as soon as they are elected do the exact opposite. There is NO private and public side, there is only the truth. If you cannot be honest with your constituents, you do not deserve to be their representative. Transparency is so important because all the corruption in our government. I believe in 100% financial transparency. That is why any person that donates to my campaign will receive a full list of where EVERY donation was spent! I hope to one day see this as common practice. Integrity is of utmost importance. We must have representatives that know the difference between right and wrong. I feel this is a quality that is severely lacking in our legislative process. If more legislators had integrity, we wouldn't need to focus on the current corruption in our government. We need disinterested Americans to run for office. We need Americans that are willing to serve their constituents because of duty and honor, not to make some quick cash. I foresee a day when we have more integrity in congress than weakness, and I see that day coming soon.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What qualities do you possess that you believe would make you a successful officeholder?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I have the honesty and integrity needed to fight the corruption in our government. I will not be bribed, I will not stop fighting, and I will not let special interests continue to purchase our legislative branch! I am a loving husband and father whose focus is making this great nation, one that we can be proud to raise our families in. A nation whose working class can pursue the American Dream. I spent 5 years as a cable guy, and I am good at it. During that time, I was blessed to be able to meet thousands of families and hear their stories, hear their complaints, hear that challenges people face every day. I am a regular guy, I work hard, I go to school to better my career, and I live through the struggles so many of us Arkansans face every day. I feel your pain. Through understanding and empathy, I am the perfect person to represent us. I am not a millionaire, I am not out of touch, I didn't grow up with a silver spoon in my mouth, I worked hard and got where I am today. If you give me a chance, elect me to replace Tom Cotton, I won't let you down. You will find yourself the proudest you have ever been to be an Arkansan, in the greatest nation on Earth.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What do you believe are the core responsibilities for someone elected to this office?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">The core responsibility of a representative is to represent those that elected to into office. To represent their constituency, and not a special interest donor. I believe the core responsibility of a representative is to fight FOR their constituent's wellbeing and happiness, not lowering those things in exchange for huge sums of money. We cannot afford to continue down the path of having no representation in the legislative branch. I am here my fellow Arkansans, I am here to give you a voice, to give you true representation. I am here my fellow Arkansans to make your voices heard!</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What legacy would you like to leave?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I want to leave my office knowing that the legislative branch has been returned to the people. We are going to be able to say we the people, finally have a voice in the legislative process. We the people, finally have true representation. We the people, finally have a government that works for us, and not us for it. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">If you could be any fictional character, who would you want to be?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Jon Snow. He is a moral levelheaded man that is disinterested in power. His goal is one thing: Peace. He does what he believes is right, even when it costs him his life. If I could live up to a standard, it would be that of Jon Snow.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What do you perceive to be the United States’ greatest challenges as a nation over the next decade?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">We have allowed ourselves to be divided to the point where we focus more on issues of little importance, and less on the issues that are changing our society. Some of the issues we should be focusing on are, wealth inequality, governmental corruption, and the climate crisis. In a time where we live in the wealthiest nation in human history, we should not be focusing on redistributing wealth form the poor to the rich. Through legislation passed by legislators that are heavily bribed we have allowed tax evasion loopholes to poison our society. these loopholes allow giant corporations to avoid taxation all together. We need to stop judging how well our society is doing by the economic growth of the top 1% and instead look at how we treat the most vulnerable of us. When 70% of working Americans are living paycheck to paycheck while the richest 1% hoards 80% of the wealth gain, there is a problem and it needs to be addressed. We need to end the corruption in our government by removing legislators financial influence in the votes they cast. We need to end congressional lobbying, we need to end citizens united, and we need to end the bribery that turned our legislators into special interest puppets. We cannot continue to let families like the Kochs, who gave candidates $400 million in 2018 alone, bribe our representatives into voting for legislation that favors them at the cost to their constituents and their families. 86% of candidates with more campaign finances ""win."" The legislators that took money from the Kochs all voted on the tax bill which saved the Kochs $25 billion in august. This bill consequently raised their constituent's income taxes in 2018 y $93 billion. We also need to address the climate crisis that is at hand. it is no longer a debate; humans have impacted the rate at which our planets climate is changing, and this will affect us all. From climate refugees, to droughts/fire, to famine, to massive storms and floods, we need to address this situation now!</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Do you believe that it’s beneficial for senators to have previous experience in government or politics?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">It does not take experience to listen to, empathize, and understand your constituents. We need our representatives to understand the struggles their constituency is facing. There are benefits to having prior experience in the legislative branch, but those benefits can also be considered a hindrance. As legislators gain decades of experience, they also gain decades of special interest friendships. This leads to favoritism and favors. I believe in term limits, which is why I signed a term limits pledge. We should rotate our legislators out in a way in which the incumbent will be required to work with their replacement for a set amount of time to show them the ropes. If a U.S. Senator is replaced, they should be required to spend their last year with their replacement to teach them the legislative practices. If a House member is replaced, they should spend 1 year, half of their term, with their replacement to teach them the legislative practices. If we rotated out our legislators in this way, we would better be able to keep fresh representation, lower governmental corruption/influence, and keep the knowledge gained from past legislators.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What criteria would you apply when deciding whether to confirm presidential appointees?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">There are so many variables that make us who we are. For such importance positions we must consider as many of these variables as possible in order to make the best possible choice. We need to look at a person's past, who they are and what made them the person they are today. We need to look at education. Not just the school attended, but how well the person did while at the institution. We need to look at experience. Experience is very important because if a person does not understand an industry, they cannot properly regulate it. It must be common practice NOT to allow an industry to regulate itself. The regulator MUST be disinterested. Last, but most not least, we need to look at documented history. A persons' documented career needs to be considered when looking to appoint them to the highest levels of our government. If 95% of a nominees' documented career is classified, there is a problem that is being hidden from the public.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Do you believe it’s beneficial to build relationships with other senators?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Absolutely. As an independent I can cross the aisle, to work with both parties. We have so many important issues that are non-partisan, that cross party lines. We need to unite, democrats, republicans, independents, greens, and libertarians to focus on these problems. If we continue the divided state in which our government is split, we will not be able to get any comprehensive legislation passed to solve these problems. I will do whatever it takes to get both parties to listen to me. I will listen to members of both parties to learn and understand their positions so that I can formulate plans that appeal to both sides. Without the ability to bring the parties together we are lost. As an independent I will mend the division and help bring focus to the problems at hand.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">If you are not a current senator, are there certain committees that you would want to be a part of?</p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">Who are you? Tell us about yourself in 300 words or less.</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Tom Lewellen has been the Executive Director of CIVIL Governance, a new political party for the last year.  It become apparent that both political parties have so much venom for one another that getting any work done is a is all but impossible, and producing any major initiative is impossible.  

Big money is directing our nation to the status quo, defined by the rich, the top 100 contributors of which gave $790 million in 2018.   They are buying influence, and frankly, the rich do not need help getting richer.  They write the laws and our vote or $10 donation won't buy a vowel.  We need a new choice and CIVIL is precisely that.  

The mission of this new party is to promote five transformational solutions that both parties should find attractive.  These include proposals to fix our retirement systems so they are financially sustainable, provide inner city parents with the same education options that rich parents get in the super zips, and simplification of regulation and government scope to make government more understandable.  Out $4.5 trillion dollar enterprise in Washington D.C. is so out of control, our trust in government is severely sagging.</p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">Please list below 3 key messages of your campaign. What are the main points you want voters to remember about your goals for your time in office?</p>
				<ul class=""key-messages"">
					<li>Make of retirement system financially stable with the CIVIL 501k.  This solution not only produced $100 trillion is person savings/investment, had this solution been used over the last fifty years a lifetime minimum wage worked would have $100,000 to improve their retirement years. </li>
					<li>CIVIL $195 pledge.  CIVIL will take no large donations but we will ask all candidates across the nation to take the CIVIL Pledge for no big money.  </li>
					<li>The sheer complexity of our government is hampering our growth and creating anger and animus.  Eighty percent of Americans distrust our government.  CIVIL is proposing a Chief Simplicity Officer to be part of the CBO to be a sanity check of out of control legislation.</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
							<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What areas of public policy are you personally passionate about?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">The United States has to put it self in a much better position to compete with China's plan to kick America to the curb of the next 30 years.   Instead of growing at 2% or 3%, the US needs to grow at 4% to 5%.  Given this pace of growth the US will stay in parity with China assuring they won't outspend America for buying friends and enforcing international policy with their military.  </p>

			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">If you are not currently a member of your party’s leadership in the U.S. House of Representatives, would you be interested in joining the leadership? If so, in what role?</p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">What would be your top three priorities, if elected?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">1. Classifying gun violence as a public health epidemic under the CDC.
2. Fighting for Progressive solutions like Medicare-for-All, A Green New Deal, Universal Pre-K, equity-based covered college, and many more priorities that seek to reinvigorate the 1st District of Illinois and eliminate everyday gun violence within a generation.
3. Guiding cultural shifts in our national perception of everyday gun violence, not only through our government’s handling of it, but the national discourse that surrounds it.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What areas of public policy are you personally passionate about?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">We must commit to ending everyday gun violence prevention within a generation. This is first and foremost. I believe that many of the issues that impact our district can trace their effects to the violence within our communities. By reversing the effects of environmental racism, providing sustainable income and education accessibility for everyone, we can mitigate the factors that allow everyday gun violence to continue in our district. We also cannot shy away from topics such as reparations, using these policy ideas to allow our communities to heal from within. Attacking gun violence at its root causes forces us to dissect each of these issues one by one, and when we do so, we can begin to unravel the issue from the ground up. This is why I am firmly convinced we can obtain peace within a generation.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Is there a book, essay, film, or something else you would recommend to someone who wants to understand your political philosophy?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">The Alchemist - The book is written in a way in which the reader becomes the protagonist. Our policies should be written in the same way. Americans should be able to see how they fit into the vision set forth in the policies.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What characteristics or principles are most important for an elected official?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">We need elected officials who:
1. Don’t believe that power derives from the elected but from the community.
2. Builds consensus, don’t simply conform to it.
3. Are compassionate and measured in their approach to solving problems.
4. Are able to empathize with all of their constituents, regardless of demographic.
5. See the best in our people and our nation, yet also see where our country can be improved.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What qualities do you possess that you believe would make you a successful officeholder?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I have and I will continue to work day and night to reinvigorate this district. I will do so by working with the community, using our collective resources and the power of Federal support to make the district stronger. The solutions to our problems are in the minds of those who understand them. Whether it’s in the mind of the little Black girl from Englewood who dreams of becoming a doctor, or the child in Manhattan, IL who dreams of becoming an Actor in Chicago, or my own grandmother, who kneels in prayer every Sunday for a more hopeful tomorrow. We cannot let progress falter and our dreams fizzle, no matter how difficult the realities of our everyday might be. This campaign is about setting our minds on the district that we deserve, then making it a reality together.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What do you believe are the core responsibilities for someone elected to this office?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Above all, our district needs a voice. This is something that we have not had in IL-01 for a very long time. We need someone who does not believe there is a monopoly on good ideas, but listens and engages with their communities from election to their last day in office. Anyone can identify the problems that impact our district, but fulfilling these core responsibilities will allow us to solve them.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What legacy would you like to leave?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">It has always been my primary focus to end gun violence within our lifetime. We can do this by fixing all of our issues from the ground-up. We need to invest in a better future for our children on day one, across the board. They should never find themselves in a position where they feel compelled to resort to gun violence. We must also work towards eliminating policies that separate families from one another. Mass incarceration has had a profound impact on the First District. We cannot achieve stability in our communities without ending the institutional racism that has torn families apart and derailed the futures of our youth for decades. I would like to leave a legacy not only for myself, but for our district. There are few places that suffer from everyday gun violence in the way that IL-01 does, and I would like us to help lead the charge in creating a reality where this problem no longer exists.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What is something that has been a struggle in your life?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">The loss of my best friend. We were roommates together at the University of Illinois at Urbana/Champaign. Despite his best efforts to bring up his academic performance, he was ultimately told that he would not be a good fit for the University and left after his freshman year. Shortly after he returned to Chicago, he was shot and killed in Chicago. The disappointment I felt towards the University quickly became disappointment towards my myself. The shame became so unbearable that I left school altogether. It took a great deal of courage for me to understand that I was not a coward because I felt such fear and shame, but that true courage was achieved if I took these feelings head on and overcame them. To this day, I still reflect on my friend, but the struggle I overcame was the most difficult of my life, and it allowed me to become the person I am today.</p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">Who are you? Tell us about yourself in 300 words or less.</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Shahid embodies San Francisco's values, and has actively represented them in both San Francisco and Washington as a legal advocate, national non-profit leader, grassroots organizer, and movement musician. Through his work building movements for peace, immigrant rights, black lives, and the Occupy movement, Shahid dedicated his career to public service long before running for public office.

An early advocate for marriage equality for same-sex couples and a prolific organizer in the movement to end warrantless surveillance, Shahid most recently built a national grassroots network for the Electronic Frontier Foundation as the organization's Director of Grassroots Advocacy. He has been building social movements and speaking truth to power for two decades, and graduated from Stanford Law School in 2003.

In addition to LGBTQ rights, privacy, and the right to encryption, Shahid's work has advanced immigrant rights, campaign finance reform, government transparency, international human rights, and police accountability. His writing has explored issues from the right-wing attack on reproductive freedom to the erosion of voting rights, and from effective counter-terrorism strategies to counter-cultural activism leveraging art &amp; culture.

More information about his background and previous advocacy before running for Congress is available at https://shahidforchange.us/more-about-shahid-buttar-pelosis-leading-2020-challenger/</p>
			</div>
						    <div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Please list below 3 key messages of your campaign. What are the main points you want voters to remember about your goals for your time in office?</p>
				<ul class=""key-messages"">
					<li>I'm here to defend democracy and prevent the consolidation of fascism</li>
					<li>I'm here to end the bipartisan consensus on corporate rule</li>
					<li>I'm here to defend human rights in crisis and expand them to include healthcare, housing, and food.</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
							<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What areas of public policy are you personally passionate about?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Shahid's writing for Huffington Post, Truthout, the Burning Man Journal, Tech Crunch, Project Censored, and academic legal journals addresses a wide range of issues, from foreign policy and counterterrorism to human rights and torture, from transparency and drone strikes to voting rights and tax law, from the crisis in executive power and corresponding threat to democracy to the bait-and-switch surrounding police body cameras.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Who do you look up to? Whose example would you like to follow, and why?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I look up to former U.S. Senator Russ Feingold, for two particular reasons.

First, I admire his willingness to cast the sole dissenting vote against the passage of the USA Patriot Act under the Bush administration. It takes tremendous courage to do the right thing in the face of an opposing consensus, especially when the recognition of what \""the right thing\"" requires may be elusive to so many others. 

I also admire Senator Feingold for his work enacting the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2003, which aimed to take corporate soft money out of politics.

I've had opportunities to work on each of these issues, which has offered the chance to examine his legacy in two distinct arenas. We need more public servants like him.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Is there a book, essay, film, or something else you would recommend to someone who wants to understand your political philosophy?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I take my marching orders from Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.'s Letter from a Birmingham Jail, in which he exhorts his supposed allies to demonstrate solidarity with communities most impacted by oppressive institutions. Many centrists expect support from more radical and marginalized voices, failing to understand that, until they demonstrate solidarity with those communities, they have no reason to offer their support, or their votes, or their volunteer hours. Our campaign, and my work as an advocate and organizer long before running for Congress, are defined by solidarity.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What qualities do you possess that you believe would make you a successful officeholder?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Even without a seat in Congress, I've done the job of representing San Francisco's voice in Washington before. When I organized the first impact litigation seeking to establish the right of consenting adults to marry the partner of their choice, I did that while working as a young lawyer in Washington, where I was organizing grassroots resistance to Bush's wars at night.

I listen actively. I empathetically strive to understand the experiences of my neighbors and would-be constituents. Over the course of my two decades advocating for civil rights and civil liberties, I've come to wield both history &amp; theory to place current policy proposals in a broader context. 

A big part of that understanding of history &amp; theory relates to intersectional feminism, post-colonial liberation, and democratic Socialism.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What is your favorite book? Why?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">\""The Autobiography of Malcolm X,\"" as told by Alex Haley. Haley's work is a masterpiece, and Malcolm's life was a remarkable reflection of resilience, adaptation, leadership, and loss. His later years, when he sought to cultivate international support for human rights within the U.S., remains an inspiring aspirational project with relevance well beyond Malcolm's own movement. For instance, the central strategy that he developed has guided much of the contemporary environmental movement. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Do you believe that it's beneficial for representatives to have previous experience in government or politics?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">On the one hand, previous experience can lend itself to an understanding of the political process and the policymaking process. On the other hand, experience in a system steeped in corruption can also be stultifying.

Thankfully, I wield two decades of experience as a national advocate for civil rights and civil liberties, without the stain of having bent my vision to accommodate the limits of an era committed to abusing human rights.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What do you perceive to be the United States’ greatest challenges as a nation over the next decade?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I'm very deeply concerned about climate chaos, our military-industrial complex, and the intersection between them. In particular, I'm concerned about both accountability for the fraud, waste, and abuse that pervades military contracting and so-called intelligence activities, as well as the way we use those activities to facilitate corporate fossil fuel extraction. human rights abuses by the CIA, in particular, are a stain on our nations conscience and mark the sacrifices of veterans who fought and died to establish human rights in the week of the second world war. The co-optation of career Democrats (many of whom are demonstrably complicit in executive secrecy) by the military industrial complex that President Eisenhower warned us to fear threatens our republic as much as a Kleptocrat in the White House.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">If you are not a current representative, are there certain committees that you would want to be a part of?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I would be most excited to serve on the House Judiciary Committee, though I would also be eager to serve on the House Select Committee on the Climate Crisis, the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, the House Foreign Affairs Committee, or the Committee on Homeland Security and Government Affairs.</p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">Who are you? Tell us about yourself in 300 words or less.</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I'm a documentary Film Producer based in Los Angeles, CA. My documentary film work explores topics such as: healthcare, education, criminal justice, human rights, and police-community relations. I've identified solutions to Federal issues that I believe are consequential to America's future. These include addressing: Taxation, Healthcare, Education, Environment, Immigration, Police &amp; Military, Jobs &amp; Economy, Foreign Policy, Defending the Constitution, and combating the proliferation of Socialism.

After more than a decade of community engagement and programming through socially-conscious documentary film work,  I am now giving back to the nation that gave me the invaluable opportunity to succeed, by being a catalyst for change and having a seat at the table in public office as I campaign for California's 37th Congressional District.</p>

						    <div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Please list below 3 key messages of your campaign. What are the main points you want voters to remember about your goals for your time in office?</p>
				<ul class=""key-messages"">
					<li>Make America Safe</li>
					<li>Make America Educated</li>
					<li>Make America Prosperous</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
							<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What areas of public policy are you personally passionate about?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">We need to recognize that a failure to adequately address key Federal issues has a negative rippling effect when it comes to State-level issues, particularly as it pertains to quality of life.

Strong immigration policy is integral to our national sovereignty and security. We need stronger immigration policy to reduce drug trade, and decrease job theft, wage suppression, and displacing American citizens from accessing the already-scarce affordable housing and services that should go to Americans.

A national investment in better, more diversified, and rigorous education is important for securing a future for America to remain an economic powerhouse. We need to promote and enforce school choice at in all school systems, as parents should retain the right and agency to choose what's best for their children.

While education equips the public, we need to ensure that access to business development resources is readily available. We're excited for the progress that has been made with Opportunity Zones in previously underserved communities, and now we need to continue by making more avenues available for community members to become stakeholders in our communities.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What characteristics or principles are most important for an elected official?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Being a politician is a daily exercise in restraint. Not being reactionary in such a way that you discount the story of the life experience of the very people who are looking to place their trust in you.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What qualities do you possess that you believe would make you a successful officeholder?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">As a documentary filmmaker, that would be my ability to tell stories and make complicated ideas easy to understand, discuss, and ideate solutions.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What do you believe are the core responsibilities for someone elected to this office?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Recognizing the role and application of our U.S. Constitution when creating or voting on legislation.
Legislating based on the needs of the constituents.
Not using their seat to exact political vengeance against opponents.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What legacy would you like to leave?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">As a politician, I would like to leave a legacy of empowering communities to civic involvement through education.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What was your very first job? How long did you have it?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I was a broadcast cameraman. In 2002, when my family and I came to the United States, I wanted to be a commercial airline pilot. Then in January 2003, at 15, I was sitting in church, and grew fascinated by how every move the broadcast camera operators made affected the outcome of what came up on the large screens at the front of the church. I saw that I could shape how one views the world through video. Curiously, I asked the video staff if they would teach me how to operate the cameras, and they obliged. The following Sunday, after a training session, they put me on camera, and I was hooked!

We later went on to going to a different church, where they had an even more elaborate video production system, and the camera operators were off-duty camera crew from a local news affiliate. Toward the end of high school, my Art teacher, recommended I check out the new film program at the Maryland Institute College of Art. I later applied to that school, and studied film there for 4 years. Upon graduation from MICA in 2008, I began shooting some two dozen documentaries.</p>

					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What qualities does the U.S. House of Representatives possess that makes it unique as an institution?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">It gives Americans equal representation based on population, and serves as one fo the checks to ensure America does not succumb to mob rule.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Do you believe that it's beneficial for representatives to have previous experience in government or politics?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">If we've learned anything from the past few election cycles, it's that just because someone is a career politician does not automatically make them better suited for a job of representing constituents as a politician. We've had many public and private sector Americans who have run for and served in political office because they believe their work experience - say in military, legal, or business - makes them uniquely skilled at addressing key issues that affect the lives of their constituents. Such as a farmer running for Congress in a District that is majority farmland or forestry, or a former law enforcement professional running for political office in a city that faces intricate nuances to addressing crime.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What do you perceive to be the United States’ greatest challenges as a nation over the next decade?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">In the face of deepening liberal irresponsibility, America's biggest challenges include remaining a sovereign nation that protects the interests of our American citizens. Over the past century, we've watched over two dozen failed socialist/communist regimes do irreparable damage to societies, and it seems that the American Left just hasn't learned, with some seem determined to repeat the very failures that led to widespread famine, death, and anarchy.

We as Conservatives and Republicans need to drive home the importance of individual rights, individual liberties, and individual responsibility as the three core tenets that guide how we as Republicans approach all policy solutions.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">If you are not a current representative, are there certain committees that you would want to be a part of?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Taking into account my platform, I would want to be part of the following committees:
-Armed Services
-Education and Labor
-Homeland Security
-Small Business
-Transportation and Infrastructure</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Do you believe that two years is the right term length for representatives?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Yes.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What are your thoughts on term limits?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Power corrupts. Absolute power corrupts absolutely. Absolute power, with no checks as it pertains to term limits places America in danger of being abused by the very lawmakers tasked with Representing the needs of their constituents. I believe that U.S. Congress members should be limited to 12 years. Six 2-year terms for Representatives, and two 6-year terms for Senators. Americans need to have an \""out\"" when it comes to dealing with errant or rogue lawmakers, and as such, I see the need for term limits.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">If you are not currently a member of your party’s leadership in the U.S. House of Representatives, would you be interested in joining the leadership? If so, in what role?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Any role that allows for me to lead departments responsible for making policy palatable, for our constituents to more fully understand what is happening with the laws that affect their lives.</p>

			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What qualities does the U.S. House of Representatives possess that makes it unique as an institution?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">The House of Representatives shares equal responsibility for lawmaking with the U.S. Senate. As conceived by the framers of the Constitution, the House was to represent the popular will of the people and its members were to be directly elected by the people.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Do you believe that it's beneficial for representatives to have previous experience in government or politics?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">No. Abilities and desires trumps prior government experience. Government experience can be a hindrance and group think can cripple growth.

We need representatives who work for the American people rather that special interests of personal gain. Hence a government background would proliferate doing things the way in the interest of government rather than the people. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What do you perceive to be the United States’ greatest challenges as a nation over the next decade?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Conservative vs. Progressive - Conservatives say people should have choices. Progressives say one political solution fits all.  Progressive takes away your freedom of choice. Whether it's the Second Amendment, immigration, or putting limits on abortion, if we the people don't pass laws progressives approve, they turn to judges, executive orders, and government bureaucrats behind closed doors to overturn the will of voters.

Health Care - Most Americans agree that the health care system in the United States is in need of an overhaul. What many are not in agreement on is how best to do it. We need to  redirect our current system-putting patients and doctors in the driver's seat, making health care providers and insurance companies compete for customers.

Religious Freedom - The first amendment to the United States constitution begins, \""Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof...\"" Fast forward almost 250 years and religious freedom is one of the most pressing issues in American culture today. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">If you are not a current representative, are there certain committees that you would want to be a part of?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Veterans - My father was a WWII seaman who boarded the USS Wichita (CA45) in the state of Washington and was in every battle in the pacific push to win the war. He was in Nagasaki harbor protecting the hospital ship helping the injured Japanese from the atomic bomb devastation. 
I am proud of my father and he taught me to respect an honor our military people, past, present and future.  I want to provide the best health care for our veterans and all Americans. 

Health care - We need to develop competitive healthcare options and keep government out of the way of our health. Especially for veterans. One such option would be to allow healthcare plans to cross state lines. 

Security - Our paramount priority for federal government and individuals. We need to keep our military the best in the world while providing personal security through the second amendment. 

International relations - I lived an worked overseas in Saudi Arabia for the largest oil company in the world, ARAMCO. I am familiar with international business relations and the successful operation of manufacturing and distribution.

Education - I believe in continuing education. I pursue mutilate degrees to better and diversify myself.</p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">Do you believe that two years is the right term length for representatives?</p>

				<p class=""survey-response""></p><p>Retired Navy Master Chief Tony Gonzales was raised between San Antonio, Devine, and Camp Wood Hills, Texas.

						    <div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Please list below 3 key messages of your campaign. What are the main points you want voters to remember about your goals for your time in office?</p>
				<ul class=""key-messages"">
					<li><p>Tony is 100% pro-life and believes all life is sacred, starting at conception. Human rights are fundamental to the core of American principles and our laws must protect it. He believes the family is the most important component in American society and advocates for pro-family legislative policies such as school choice, expanding the child tax credit, and supporting advanced skills to adult learners. The family unit is at the heart of American society and thus must be supported with opportunities, not hand-outs.  The U.S. government should focus on its future generation of citizens by improving access for adult learners to earn a livable wage through reduction of unnecessary regulations and streamlining the trade skill certification process.</p></li>
					<li><p>Tony supports a strong national defense and foreign policy based on the principles of American military strength, active protection of our economy, and constant advocacy for our core values around the globe.  Tony unequivocally supports the right to keep and bear arms. He will always support our 2nd Amendment rights and advocate in any forum when they are infringed upon. Tony supports the construction of a border wall where appropriate, enhanced use of technology to cover vast rural areas, increasing manpower along the border, and a modern entry/exit program. Ultimately, we MUST adopt an 'all-of-the-above' approach to secure the border and keep our families safe.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></li>
					<li><p>Economic opportunities and free Enterprise are at the center of a thriving community. Tony is focused on reducing regulations to support the dignity of work for blue collar Americans who are fighting to better the lives of themselves and their families. The individual knows how to best spend their money, not government, and Tony supports cutting taxes along with unnecessary regulations which increases the cost of doing business for small business owners.  The American dream is what makes our nation special and part of that dream is having employment which can provide a livable wage. Attending higher learning institutions is important when obtaining new skills but equally as important are earning these skills through trade programs.&nbsp;</p></li>
				</ul>
			</div>
							<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What areas of public policy are you personally passionate about?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Education is the ultimate equalizer and we all benefit when a child reaches their full potential in life. Tony supports all forms of educational opportunities to include, but not limited to, charter schools, public schools, private schools, religious schools, and home schooling. He understands that education is primarily a state and local issue but encourages federal involvement when appropriate. Tony's five children have attended all different types of schools during his 20 years in military service, and he believes \""choice\"" should be left up to the parents.

The world looks to America for leadership and guidance as we fight a rise in terrorism, intellectual theft, human rights violations, and dictatorship. America has the most formidable military in the world, and we must maintain constant support to our warriors in the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, Coast Guard, and Intelligence community to ensure they successfully combat our adversaries. This also means that we must support our veterans when they return home and ensure they have access to the healthcare they deserve.

Maintaining and improving access to quality healthcare through a capitalist-based system.</p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">Who are you? Tell us about yourself in 300 words or less.</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I am a first-generation American, a small business owner, and proud community member and activist.  My parents came to this country seeking a better life, and growing up, I knew the power and the promise of the American Dream.  I seek to bring that experience and understanding to Congress, where I will work in the interest of everyday Americans, not the special interests and PACs that Washington politicians work for.

I have always had a deep desire to improve my community.  I have been involved in working to improve the lives of both Americans as well as people around the world.  I have served as a member of the Executive Board of AMVote PAC, where I have worked to increase voter registration and political engagement in the 3rd Congressional District, and served on the transition team for Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot.

In addition to working to improve my community, I am a small business owner.  I was a newscaster for ten years, after which I started an award-winning multimedia production company.  However, I am most proud of being a husband to my wonderful wife, Aziza and a father to my two boys, Adam and Amir.</p>

						    <div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Please list below 3 key messages of your campaign. What are the main points you want voters to remember about your goals for your time in office?</p>
				<ul class=""key-messages"">
					<li>Providing universal health care by enrolling every uninsured American in Medicare while allowing people who have insurance through their employer to keep it.</li>
					<li>Ensuring a pathway to citizenship for the 11 million undocumented immigrants who are already here and are contributing to our society.</li>
					<li>We have to get big money out of politics.  This campaign is built on a grassroots movement of people engaging in the political process for the first time and is free of any PAC money.</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
							<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What areas of public policy are you personally passionate about?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I am personally very invested in making sure that our immigration system is fair and allows good people who play by the rules, regardless of status, to have pathways to citizenship.  As the son of immigrants, I know that immigrants have strong work ethic and want to provide for their families.  Another issue that I am passionate about is campaign finance reform.  I feel strongly that elected officials need to work for us, and not special interests and PACs.  I am the only candidate who has sworn off all PAC money in this race, because I am committed to being an independent and un-bought voice for the people of the 3rd district. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Who do you look up to? Whose example would you like to follow, and why?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">If there is one person I look up to, it is undoubtedly Nelson Mandela.  Through all conflict and adversity he faced, he never wavered on his mission of working towards equality for all South Africans.  Despite being told that apartheid in South Africa would last forever, and despite being imprisoned for 27 years, he persisted and eventually became president and led his country out of apartheid, and unified the country in the process.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Is there a book, essay, film, or something else you would recommend to someone who wants to understand your political philosophy?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Forrest Gump - seriously.  The movie depicts a hard-working everyman who seeks to better the world.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What characteristics or principles are most important for an elected official?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I firmly support being a straight shooter and being open to new ideas from constituents and people in my community.  Representatives who abide by those principles are always more effective at serving their constituents.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What qualities do you possess that you believe would make you a successful officeholder?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I believe my experience as somebody who comes from an area where people feel left behind and disenfranchised, and my past experience as an activist in that community, give me the understanding of what it is like for everyday people who feel disenchanted by the political system and how to get those folks involved in the political process. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What do you believe are the core responsibilities for someone elected to this office?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I firmly believe in the responsibility of any representative to work for their constituents and their community, and to remain deeply embedded in their community.  That is the only way for a representative to truly help those who they represent, and I hope to deliver on those responsibilities as your next Congressman.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What legacy would you like to leave?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I would like to be able to look back on my activism and time in politics and say that I was able to engage a new group of people in the political process, and get people energized enough to get involved and run for office.  We need a lot more people to not only vote, but to be actively engaged, and I hope that my candidacy can open the door for more people to become engaged and involved activists and voters.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What is the first historical event that happened in your lifetime that you remember? How old were you at the time?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">When I was in the 3rd grade, Ronald Reagan started an initiative called ""Hands Across America,"" which promoted unity among all Americans regardless of background or political affiliation.  I remember this initiative because it brought so many different types of people together in a way that I had never seen before, which impacted me deeply.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What was your very first job? How long did you have it?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">When I was in high school, I worked at the Yankee Doodle Restaurant in Bensonville, Illinois, where I was the janitor.  For a year and a half, I worked for $4.75 an hour, cleaning every nook and cranny of the restaurant, including the fryer, which often resulted in burns on my hands and arms.  Even my own mother begged me to quit because of the injuries I sustained while working there, and the 3 people I trained while working there all quit in a matter of days.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What was the last song that got stuck in your head?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Imagine by John Lennon</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What is something that has been a struggle in your life?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">One struggle I've experienced, particularly in the last several years, has been finding the time to balance spending time with my family, my business, and my community activism.  I wish I had more time to accomplish all the things I want to change in my community.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What qualities does the U.S. House of Representatives possess that makes it unique as an institution?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">The U.S. House of Representatives is a great institution because as the people's house, it is an effective governmental body in representing the interests and will of the American people at the federal level.  Because of it's large body of members, and due to its increasingly diverse ranks, the House can be and often is an effective tool of representation for those that are not represented by other federal government bodies and elected positions.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Do you believe that it's beneficial for representatives to have previous experience in government or politics?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I feel that we need new voices and new vision, and we need everday people to solve everday problems
We have let longtime politicians try to solve our problems, and they have failed, because politicians over time begin to only serve special interests and PACs</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What do you perceive to be the United States’ greatest challenges as a nation over the next decade?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">While Americans and our country face numerous issues, our number one greatest challenge over the next decade is the hate and division that has both resurfaced and taken a deeper root in our country in the last several years.  We have seen the terrifying results that occur when hate is used as an effective political strategy and wins elections.  As your next congressman, I will stand up and be a voice for the community which speaks out against hate and division, and not let the rhetoric that supports that ideology to go unchallenged.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">If you are not a current representative, are there certain committees that you would want to be a part of?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Transportation and Infrastructure 
Foreign Affairs</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Do you believe that two years is the right term length for representatives?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I believe that four years would be a better term of office for members of the United States House of Representatives.  Due to the two-year term, representatives are forced to spend all their time campaigning for re-election and raising money, instead of doing the legitimate and much-needed work of bringing results to their communities.  I believe that a four-year term would resolve, or at least mitigate some of these issues.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What are your thoughts on term limits?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Representatives should not hold their seats for life.  I believe that a 12-year term limit in both houses would be sufficient.  That would allow representatives and senators to have ample time to settle in as elected officials and learn the system, while still ensuring that they do not hold their seats for too long.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">If you are not currently a member of your party’s leadership in the U.S. House of Representatives, would you be interested in joining the leadership? If so, in what role?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">At the Darwish campaign, we are focused on representing the residents of the 3rd district.  If I were elected, and my colleagues in the House invited me to join leadership, I would be happy to do so.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Is there a particular representative, past or present, whom you want to model yourself after?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I believe that representatives should spend their time focusing on the needs of constituents and delivering the resources they need, not hobnobbing in Washington, D.C. with special interests.  The representatives who do this are those that I would seek to model myself after.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Both sitting representatives and candidates for office hear many personal stories from the residents of their district. Is there a story that you’ve heard that you found particularly touching, memorable, or impactful?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I know somebody who is afraid to go out and work because he is worried that he will be detained by ICE.  I am not willing to disclose more details to protect this individual's identity, but he is afraid to go our and even work because he is worried that he will be detained while on the job.</p>

				<p class=""survey-response"">Healthcare
Income Inequality and corruption in Washington
Women's Rights</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What areas of public policy are you personally passionate about?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">The difficulties faced by working and middle class Americans.  
Healthcare should be a human right... the working and middle classes are frequently the most affected by the greed of the insurance and pharmaceutical companies.  
Women should be free from oppression in society.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Who do you look up to? Whose example would you like to follow, and why?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">My children and the youth in America today. I am so inspired by the amount of youth and young people making a stand for things which affect their futures.  They are an impassioned group of individuals, who are willing to step outside of their comfort zone to advocate for their futures... we should all be inspired and motivated by them.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What characteristics or principles are most important for an elected official?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">The ability to look outside of their own safe world to recognize the needs of the people they represent.  Too often, elected officials represent their own interests at the expense of those they should be representing</p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">Who are you? Tell us about yourself in 300 words or less.</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I 'm living the American Dream. I was born and raised in Utah. I am now raising my own family here. I have worked the ranch and run my businesses here. Its time we take care of the little people again</p>
			</div>
						    <div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Please list below 3 key messages of your campaign. What are the main points you want voters to remember about your goals for your time in office?</p>
				<ul class=""key-messages"">
					<li>The People come first.  It is beyond time that the people of this Country get their voice back! They should always be the first ones considered.</li>
					<li>Less taxes, Less new laws, start enforcing the laws that we already have, and being accountable to those we represent.</li>
					<li>Getting the budget under control is something that has to be done. It is my generation that is going to have to deal with it!</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
							<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What areas of public policy are you personally passionate about?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I  personally am passionate about all things America, but especially the average American. What do they need, want and feel. How can we help them to succeed in their life? This is something that is not happening.  It's the average person that makes this country go round, and they are getting walked over every single day.  We also need to start protecting our farmers, Ranchers and Agriculture. We are losing 1000's of farms a year.... and we need to look to the future to be able to feed a growing country, safely and affordably.  It is just time that we use some common sense.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Who do you look up to? Whose example would you like to follow, and why?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">There are 2 people in history that I really looked up to. George Washington and Ronald Regan. They both stuck out to me as men of character. Men that were well rounded and versed in many areas of life. The thing that I appreciated most about them is their love of this country. How much they cared for the individuals!</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Is there a book, essay, film, or something else you would recommend to someone who wants to understand your political philosophy?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">2 Books sum it up pretty well.       Being George Washington by Glen Beck and Love your Enemies by Arthur C Brooks</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What characteristics or principles are most important for an elected official?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Honesty, Integrity, Fortitude and a moral compass that points the right direction. Not to mention ears that hear.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What qualities do you possess that you believe would make you a successful officeholder?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I learned many things growing up working the ranch. The biggest one being \"" Do what is right, Not what is easy\"" This is something that I feel the world is really missing. I have been raised in a way that I can do tough things. That there is nothing we cannot overcome. I spend time with people. I have been blessed with a gift of empathy to be able to relate and feel what people are going through. In my line of work. If you are not honest, You don't get anywhere.  It's time our Reps are Honest, Work Hard and do what they say they are going to even if its not the easy path.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What do you believe are the core responsibilities for someone elected to this office?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">LISTEN to the people and do what is in the best interest of them!</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What legacy would you like to leave?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I want to leave a legacy, that people loved me, because I cared. That everyone that meets me, knows that I will do everything I can to make their life a little better. That they are important to me that their voice matters. I want people to remember me for that. That I was a normal person just like them. I never settled for less. That I looked at the big tasks not as insurmountable mountains, but as a series of problems that needed to be solved. That maybe I was born a humble sheep farmer, but could rise in this country to do great things and leave the world a better place.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What is the first historical event that happened in your lifetime that you remember? How old were you at the time?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I remember seeing Regan on TV as a small child, but the biggest thing that is clear in my mind was the 9/11 attacks. I was 12 years old.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What was your very first job? How long did you have it?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">My family owns a sheep ranch. I have done that ever since I could walk. I still do part time today, when not running my other businesses </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What is your favorite book? Why?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Love your Enemies By Arthur C Brooks. It taught me a lot more about myself, and how I treat and deal with other people than I ever thought that I didn't know!</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">If you could be any fictional character, who would you want to be?</p>

					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What was the last song that got stuck in your head?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Western Skies by Chris LeDoux</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What is something that has been a struggle in your life?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">The one thing that I have learned is that everyone has a struggle even if we don't see it. In my adult life I have struggled with many things. One of which is building and sustaining a small business. It is not easy but there are so many people that do it and I really feel for them.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What qualities does the U.S. House of Representatives possess that makes it unique as an institution?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">What I love about the House is that it can and should be made up of average citizens. Our friends and neighbors. Giving representation to those who deserve it most, THE PEOPLE. Our founders wanted it this way. It should always be a place where the average persons well being is considered first.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Do you believe that it's beneficial for representatives to have previous experience in government or politics?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Absolutely not, I think that has led us into problems that we are seeing now. We have created a climate of people in government who are very disconnected with the people that they are called to represent. How can you do what is best for someone if you have no idea what they are going through.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What do you perceive to be the United States’ greatest challenges as a nation over the next decade?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Overcoming the divide that exists between the 2 parties and bringing the country back together to start working for the people again.  So that we can start to work on overcoming the national debt. So we don't leave my generation with a country that belongs to other countries.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">If you are not a current representative, are there certain committees that you would want to be a part of?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I would love to be on the Agricultural and Small Business commodities. Having spent most all of my life in both of those fields. I also think I could be a benefit to the Natural Resources committee as well because of my vast time spend in that area.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Do you believe that two years is the right term length for representatives?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Yes, I think that it keeps our reps accountable to the people. It makes them realize that they must do a good job because people are always watching. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What are your thoughts on term limits?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I have mixed feelings on them. I don't believe that the House of Reps should be a lifetime job, absolutely not. I also think that there are many good people there that we continually benefit from having there.  It is something that really needs to be looked hard at!</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Is there a particular representative, past or present, whom you want to model yourself after?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Not in particular, each has some qualities that I like and some I don't. I want to be the person that does right by the people.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Both sitting representatives and candidates for office hear many personal stories from the residents of their district. Is there a story that you’ve heard that you found particularly touching, memorable, or impactful?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I listen to people who struggle to make ends meet. Only to be taxed by roughly 37%, and then have their health insurance cost outrageous amounts.

				<p class=""survey-question"">Who are you? Tell us about yourself in 300 words or less.</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Teresa Tomlinson is an 8th generation Georgian with roots all over the state. She spent the first half of her life in Atlanta, where she graduated from Chamblee High School, and the second half in Columbus, Georgia with her husband Trip.

In January 2019, Teresa finished her second highly successful term as the first woman Mayor and Public Safety Director of Columbus, Georgia. As mayor, Tomlinson was the chief elected official of Georgia's second-largest city. She led Columbus through a time of innovative transformation, shaking up the status quo to deliver results for its citizens. She revitalized blighted and under-utilized neighborhoods, improved city services, reformed its budget in the face of declining revenues, dramatically reduced crime, increased citizen engagement and set a vision for unprecedented vibrancy. Thanks to her leadership, Columbus earned a spot as one of the top 25 Best Run Cities in America.

				<p class=""survey-question"">Please list below 3 key messages of your campaign. What are the main points you want voters to remember about your goals for your time in office?</p>
				<ul class=""key-messages"">
					<li>I will move to protect and strengthen the Affordable Care Act (ACA).</li>
					<li>I support efforts to ensure the integrity of the voting process and improve our election security, including hand-marked paper ballots as the superior alternative for every election, given that they can be audited after disputed election outcomes.</li>
					<li>I believe that politicians should stay out of the private and highly individualized medical considerations of a woman's reproductive health.</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
							<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What areas of public policy are you personally passionate about?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">While we overcame many 20th century challenges including the Great Depression, two World Wars, Watergate, and the Gulf War; today we face new systemic challenges both nationally and globally. Teresa knows that if we are to seize our future and the prosperity our nation is capable of, we will need a New Civic Infrastructure. We must work to guarantee voter rights in all 50 states, correct a justice system that results in mass incarceration, stop the crisis and inhumanity at our border, reform our immigration system, ensure that we live free from the onslaught of gun violence, support basic bodily autonomy for women, and recognize the equality of all citizens (including LGBTQ+ citizens) to pursue and enjoy our unalienable rights.

Similarly, Teresa knows our economic infrastructure is also a relic of the 20th century. We need to build a New Economic Infrastructure: provide universal healthcare by expanding Medicare and Medicaid while allowing people to keep their private health insurance; establish a fair wage and a mechanism to have that wage keep pace with inflation; rethink our tax system to grow the middle class and strengthen pathways for those climbing out of poverty; end the racial and gender wealth gaps and find a way that all of our people have access to capital, power, and prosperity; help students afford college and recent graduates restructure their staggering student loan debt.

				<p class=""survey-question"">What would be your top three priorities, if elected?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">My top priority will continue to be fighting the opioid epidemic that is devastating communities in New Hampshire and across the country.  In 2015, I created the Bipartisan Opioid Task Force in Congress that now includes over 100 Members of Congress, Democrats and Republicans.  The Task Force has led the way on passage of legislation to bring millions of dollars in assistance for first responders, treatment providers, health care professionals, law enforcement,  and others that are working to save lives across the Granite State.

As the Ranking Member of the Veterans Affairs Committee Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee, I am dedicated to serving those who have served our country.  I was one of two Democratic cosponsors of the VA MISSION Act that made it easier for all veterans in New Hampshire to get care in their communities and helped improve protections for whistleblowers who identify waste, fraud, and abuse within the VA.

Finally, I am fighting to spur greater job creation and opportunity to help hardworking Granite Staters get ahead.  Earlier this year I released my Jobs and opportunity Agenda that is focused on creating more apprenticeships and vocational training, making college more affordable, and improving child care and paid family leave.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What areas of public policy are you personally passionate about?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Like voters across New Hampshire, I'm tired of the bickering and fighting in
Congress and want to deliver real results for people in the Granite State. I've
focused on bridging the gap between Republicans and Democrats to take
meaningful action to address the opioid epidemic and improve access to care for
veterans in our state. Granite State families deserve a representative who will fight
for them every day. I'm eager to continue standing up for our men and women
who have served in uniform, helping to end the opioid epidemic plaguing our state,
and expanding economic opportunity so that every Granite Stater is able to build
the future they want for their family right here in New Hampshire.</p>

						    <div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Please list below 3 key messages of your campaign. What are the main points you want voters to remember about your goals for your time in office?</p>
				<ul class=""key-messages"">
					<li>I will continue to fight for affordable, quality healthcare and lower prescription drug prices. No one should have to choose between paying for food and rent, or vital healthcare services and prescriptions.</li>
					<li>I will always advocate for environmental protection; combatting the climate crisis and promoting the creation of well-paying jobs through the expansion of the growing clean energy economy have been top priorities of my time in office, and my previous work as an environmental attorney.</li>
					<li>I'm proud to represent the district that includes the Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton, and I will continue working to improve the lives of the active duty service members, veterans, and their families in our community and across the nation. I will work tirelessly until veteran homelessness is an issue of the past.</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
							<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What areas of public policy are you personally passionate about?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I believe that spending as much time as possible in communities and neighborhoods across the district gives me the invaluable opportunity to hear directly from my constituents, so I can better represent them in Washington. 

During my first twelve months in office, I have:

Co-sponsored over 233 bills, resolutions, or amendments, over 131 of which are bipartisan.

Introduced 32 bills, resolutions, or amendments, 17 of which have passed in the House.

Held a Town Hall every month, and I have pledged to continue to hold a monthly Town Hall for as long as I have the honor to serve in office.

Held 25 constituent coffees in the community and for constituents visiting Washington, DC.

Held 12 House Parties, bringing the total number to over 210 in neighborhoods across the district since I announced my candidacy in 2017.

During the 2020 appropriations process, I played a leadership role to secure funding for many of our priorities in the 49th District.

For more information, please visit MikeLevin.org.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What do you believe are the core responsibilities for someone elected to this office?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">We are living in unprecedented times that require accountability, transparency, and a free press. I believe that it's important to hold Washington accountable, now more than ever, and that we must protect the truth, defend our democracy, and put country over party.

I also believe that Congress has a responsibility to secure our election systems against foreign interference and prevent further attempts by foreign powers to influence the results of the 2020 election.

I take the title of \""representative\"" quite literally. From a big picture perspective, what I've tried to do whenever possible is to work across party lines to solve local problems - to be the best representative possible for our constituents in the 49th District.  

As evidence of that, well over half of the bills, resolutions, or amendments that I've introduced or cosponsored have been bipartisan. Even though I've only been on the job for a year, I am proud of what we've been able to accomplish thus far.
</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What legacy would you like to leave?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I hope to be remembered first as a dedicated father and loving husband.

In terms of my service in Congress, I ran as a clean energy advocate and an environmental attorney with well over a decade of experience in helping to grow the clean energy industry, and I hope that I can make my mark accelerating our transition to a cleaner and safer future for our planet.

When I got to Congress, I had the incredible honor of being named to the new Select Committee on the Climate Crisis, which I think is appropriately named: This is a crisis. If you look at the recent National Climate Assessment, the latest report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, and the most recent data from NOAA and NASA, there is no question whatsoever that there is a significant climate crisis and that we are contributing to it by virtue of emitting too much carbon into the atmosphere. We need an all-hands-on-deck strategy to get policy outcomes that address climate change in a manner that is mindful of environmental and social justice.

I strongly believe that a shift to a clean and renewable energy economy does not have to come at the expense of jobs. Quite the opposite: an accelerated transition to renewables will help us grow the clean energy jobs of the future.

I also hope to finally get the spent nuclear fuel off our coast at San Onofre.  Since Southern California Edison shut down the San Onofre nuclear plant, they have stored 1,700 tons of spent nuclear fuel at the site. This highly radioactive waste will be dangerous for as long as 24,000 years, but is kept in metal containers that are designed to last a few decades at most. The site is threatened by earthquakes, tsunamis and rising sea levels. A recent study said a nuclear accident at San Onofre could cost the region $13.4 trillion dollars in damage.

Since being sworn into Congress on January 3rd, 2019, I have taken the lead in finding a permanent solution and I wrote legislation to prioritize it's removal.</p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">What is the first historical event that happened in your lifetime that you remember? How old were you at the time?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">On January 28, 1986, when I was 7 years old, I vividly remember the tragic explosion of the NASA Space Shuttle Challenger, which killed all seven crew members aboard. Like many, I remember watching the live broadcast of the launch and particularly the story of Christa McAuliffe, who was to become the first teacher in space.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What do you perceive to be the United States’ greatest challenges as a nation over the next decade?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">One of the greatest challenges that we face in the United States is our growing debt and deficits, which will become an incredible burden for future generations if we don't take responsible action now. Largely because of the 2017 tax bill, we have added $3 trillion to the debt, which is simply not sustainable. I believe that we need a bipartisan commission, like the Simpson-Bowles commission from a number of years ago, to address both revenue and spending to make sure that we get things back on track for our children and grandchildren. I'm ready to work with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to get this done.</p>

					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">If you are a current representative, why did you join your current committees?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">As an environmental attorney and the father of two young children, I am very concerned about the health of our environment and the future of our planet. Accordingly, I'm honored to serve on the House Natural Resources Committee, and the House Select Committee on the Climate Crisis.

Our District has 45,000 veterans, one of the largest populations in the nation. When I was elected in 2018, I made it my top priority to secure a seat on the House Veterans' Affairs Committee. I was also honored to be selected as Chair of the Economic Opportunities Subcommittee.

By building bipartisan coalitions, I have had outstanding success in improving services for veterans. Two of my bills, one improving educational opportunities for veterans and another to strengthen the affordable veterans home loan program, have passed Congress and been signed into law.

Some of my other priorities include protecting veterans from predatory for-profit schools, eliminating homelessness among veterans, expanding eligibility for counseling at the VA, and assisting veterans in successfully transitioning to civilian life.

I also secured $128 million to improve living conditions for active duty Marines stationed at Camp Pendleton.

Despite the deep divisions and intense partisanship in Washington DC, I know that we can work together to find common sense solutions.

				<p class=""survey-question"">Both sitting representatives and candidates for office hear many personal stories from the residents of their district. Is there a story that you’ve heard that you found particularly touching, memorable, or impactful?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">On August 2nd of last year, Dr. Pat Davis and his family were relaxing at Grandview Beach in my district, celebrating his wife's triumph over breast cancer. Suddenly, a coastal bluff collapsed, killing Dr. Davis's wife, one of his daughters, and his sister-in-law. The tragedy had a profound impact on myself and our entire community. 

Since that fateful day, I fought tooth and nail to get the federal funding needed to advance projects that will help secure coastal bluffs in our region. As my guest for the State of the Union, Dr. Davis and I highlighted the urgent need for federal action to secure coastal bluffs, and I am proud that we were able to get significant funding that will help ensure that nobody else has to experience the same tragedy as the Davis family.

				<p class=""survey-question"">Who are you? Tell us about yourself in 300 words or less.</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Desiree was born and raised in Dayton, Ohio. She is a proud product of Dayton Public Schools. After graduating from Dayton Dunbar High School, Desiree became the first in her family to graduate from a four-year college and attended Xavier University. Most recently she is a graduate of Georgetown Law.

As an undergraduate at Xavier University, Desiree joined the 2008 Obama presidential campaign as a volunteer in Southwest Ohio. Later, that experience would land her in The White House during President Barack Obama's first presidential term. Following her time at The White House, Desiree began working on Capitol Hill for United States senators Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) and Kirsten Gillibrand (D-New York). She was also elected to serve as President of the Senate Black Legislative Staff Caucus.

While on Capitol Hill, Desiree worked on important policy issues that ranged from the reauthorization of the farm bill, minimum wage, affordable child care, healthcare, and climate change. This work solidified her passion for public policy and advocacy for the everyday worker, which led Desiree to serve in senior advisory role to the League of Conservation Voters and Child Care Aware of America.

						    <div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Please list below 3 key messages of your campaign. What are the main points you want voters to remember about your goals for your time in office?</p>
				<ul class=""key-messages"">
					<li>Strengthening our economy and investing in good paying jobs</li>
					<li>Ending gun violence through commonsense gun safety measures</li>
					<li>Advocating for healthcare justice by lowering the cost of insurance and prescription drugs, and protecting women's healthcare</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
							<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What areas of public policy are you personally passionate about?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I am passionate about ending gun violence in our community, strengthening our economy, and advancing healthcare justice. I want to see gun violence end in our generation, through measures like universal background checks and Red Flag laws. I also want to invest in a strong economy by rebuilding our infrastructure, investing in Green Jobs, and protecting our workers' right to organize. I am also running for Congress to promote healthcare access through a public option, lower the cost of prescription drugs, and protecting women's healthcare decisions.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What do you believe are the core responsibilities for someone elected to this office?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Elected officials are responsible to the communities that they represent and reflect the values of their community.  At the core, elected officials are public servants and must be responsive to the needs of their constituents. I've worked in public service nearly my whole life, and I look forward to being a strong advocate for my constituents when elected.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What was your very first job? How long did you have it?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I worked at McDonald's where I earned $5.15 per hour. It was an eye-opening experience, where I learned the value of hard work. I learned harsh truths about the minimum wage and how working people are often overworked, underpaid, and underappreciated. Workers deserve to be treated better and their right to organize should be respected and championed. I am advocating for a $15 minimum wage and will be a strong fighter to protect workers' rights. My grandfather moved to Ohio to seek better opportunities in the steel mills, and I grew up in a working class family. I understand the importance of economic opportunity and respecting the dignity of work--and it's why I'm running.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Do you believe that it's beneficial for representatives to have previous experience in government or politics?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Yes, I think it's very beneficial. Government is a key institution and a bedrock of our democracy. The ability to navigate the intricacies of public policy can lead to the develop of strong laws that benefit our communities, like Dayton. To be an effective legislator and advocate, representatives need experience in the community and on the official side. I have both.  I was born and raised in Dayton and I have real roots here in the community. I also learned a great deal about legislating effectively while working for Senator Brown and Senator Gillibrand. I believe my experience will allow me to be the most effective advocate for my community.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What do you perceive to be the United States’ greatest challenges as a nation over the next decade?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I believe climate change will be the most pertinent issue facing our nation. We don't have much time left to address the climate, so we must act now to reverse the disastrous impact on our environment. I used to work for the League of Conservation Voters to advance environmental justice and I look forward to doing the same in Congress. I also believe that income inequality and poverty is one of the greatest challenges that need to be addressed. Too many people are working two or three jobs to make ends meet and it's hurting communities like mine. We need bold policies to address poverty, like investing in Green jobs, rebuilding our infrastructure, and raising the minimum wage.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Both sitting representatives and candidates for office hear many personal stories from the residents of their district. Is there a story that you’ve heard that you found particularly touching, memorable, or impactful?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I recently spoke with a voter, who runs her own small business where she imports and exports products. She was recently widowed and started this small business with her late husband. She was telling me about the impact of the recent tariffs on her business. The tariffs had created a chokehold on her business, and she was rapidly losing money and stability to the point that she had to rely on family members to help her out. This isn't an unusual story in the district. Many small business owners are suffering economically and many working class families struggle to make ends meet. Southwest Ohio was hit hard by the recession and never fully recovered. This administration's policies have hurt small business owners and working families even more. I'm running to help working families recover and to revitalize the economy in Southwest Ohio.</p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">What would be your top three priorities, if elected?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Health care is a human right and we must make it more affordable and accessible for every American. Nobody should be one health care crisis away from bankruptcy, yet that is the reality many people face. That is why I have founded and currently co-lead the Medicare for All caucus in the U.S. House of Representatives and why I founded the Medicare for All PAC, to support candidates and initiatives that want to expand Medicare to all as soon as possible.
Ensuring equality for every single person. Our country stands at a crossroads, with the Trump administration encouraging, inciting, and promoting hate, racism, sexism, homophobia, and xenophobia. I will continue my 25-year track record of fighting for equality at every level, including: racial and social justice equity through criminal justice reform; just and humane immigration reform that creates a clear path to citizenship and stops criminalizing asylum seekers; and LGBTQ advocacy and gender equity, at a time when the rights of transgender and other LGBTQ people are under attack. I will ensure that we bring the most marginalized voices to the table and stand up for those who are being left behind, and I will help to lead the fight for respect, dignity, and human rights for all.
Fighting for workers and economic equality. Workers are the backbone of our country and I will always stand up for the right to organize unions, which have helped us to build the middle class as we know it. I will continue to prioritize increasing the federal minimum wage, strengthening labor protections, ensuring childcare and paid safe &amp; sick leave, and gender pay equity. Part of this includes passing my College For All legislation, which would ensure that our workers who chose to attain a higher education can begin their careers without being crippled by student debt.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What areas of public policy are you personally passionate about?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I am a proud immigrant to this country and I have always said that immigration is not just about policy and borders â€“ it is about what we as a nation stand for. I am proudly the first Indian-American woman in Congress, but I do not want to be the last, and I am passionate about ensuring that the opportunities I have had are open to everyone.

In addition to the policy priorities listed above, I am blessed to represent a beautiful part of our Pacific Northwest and I am passionate about protecting our land, air and water. That's why I have co-authored the 100 By '50 Act to take on climate change, move to renewable clean energy, prevent new pipelines, and ensure that workers and families benefit as we transition away from fossil fuels.</p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">Who are you? Tell us about yourself in 300 words or less.</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">My name is Moe Davis and I am a retired Air Force Colonel. I'm also a former Chief Prosecutor at Guantanamo Bay, national security expert, judge and law professor. My wife, Lisa, and I live in Asheville, N.C., and we have a daughter, Ashley. 

I was born and raised in Shelby, N.C., and worked on the family farm on weekends. I attended Appalachian State, then obtained my law degree from N.C. Central University and joined the Air Force in 1983. I served for 25 years, rising to Colonel in 2001, before retiring in 2008. I have been a frequent guest on ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox, MSNBC and NPR. 

During my career, I stood up to both Republican and Democratic administrations. I resigned as chief prosecutor at Guantanamo Bay because I refused to use evidence obtained through torture as required in the Bush Administration. I also took on the Obama Administration, suing the Library of Congress in a case of free speech. And I won.

I have served my country, now I look forward to serving the people of Western North Carolina.</p>

						    <div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Please list below 3 key messages of your campaign. What are the main points you want voters to remember about your goals for your time in office?</p>
				<ul class=""key-messages"">
					<li>The poverty rate in Western North Carolina is persistently high. That's in part because jobs don't pay a living wage. We need to change that. I will fight for a $15 living wage and work to add jobs that pay well, building much-needed infrastructure in our district. We also need to create incentives for green jobs in solar energy that protect the environment, which is a critical economic driver in Western North Carolina.</li>
					<li>I support a single-payer plan -- whether it is called Medicare For All or any other name -- that recognizes access is a human right and puts healthcare above corporate profits. . Right now, the per capita cost of healthcare is more than $10,000 per person in America, with almost 1 in 10 Americans uninsured. That's in some cases double the cost per person compared to other developed countries, where every citizen has healthcare coverage. We are paying a lot more, but not getting the same results. It doesn't make sense. Uninsured rates in Western North Carolina counties are even higher than the national average. A single-payer plan will ensure that every citizen has access to care. Once and for all.</li>
					<li>We need to invest in K-12 education. We can't just rely on property taxes, because we know that means wealthier communities will have the funding to provide better educations and poorer communities will struggle to educate. Nor can we rely on the state to come through to close the gap in funding. North Carolina isn't doing that. We need much greater federal investment in raising teacher pay. We need a major expansion in Title I funding to help close the gap so our K-12 students in rural communities will have the same quality public school education. Funding K-12 public education is an investment in our future. I will support that investment. </li>
				</ul>
			</div>
							<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What areas of public policy are you personally passionate about?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I am passionate about policies that will help Western North Carolina. We need a living wage and better jobs, including jobs in industries such as solar energy that pay well and help protect the environment that is such a significant economic driver in our region. We need access to healthcare, and a single-payer system that won't bankrupt families. And we need to do more to improve education and end the cycle of poverty in our region.</p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">Who are you? Tell us about yourself in 300 words or less.</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I am a pastor, father, and leader in the community. In 2016 I founded Holland United Church of Christ, the first UCC congregation in Holland. Holland UCC has been active on justice issues and is a growing force for good in Ottawa County. My values and faith compel me to recognize the inherent dignity and worth of every human. I am running for Congress because I continually witness how many people's voices are not heard and needs not addressed.  The dignity of a person should not be determined by the amount of money in their wallet. Big money influencing our politics is one of the greatest corruptors of democracy, influencing nearly every issue and eroding the foundation of our democracy. Throughout this campaign, I am seeking to raise the thoughtfulness and intelligence of political discourse in Michigan's Second District. We must elevate truth and take a deep dive into the complexities of the issues-complexities too often ignored in favor of shallow sound bites. Inspired by the life of Jesus, I have sought to create space for those who have been left out, to advocate for those who are disadvantaged, and to create communities of people who want to bring goodness into the world. Running for Congress gives me an opportunity to work for the good of all my neighbors in West Michigan.</p>

						    <div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Please list below 3 key messages of your campaign. What are the main points you want voters to remember about your goals for your time in office?</p>
				<ul class=""key-messages"">
					<li>We need campaign finance reform.</li>
					<li>We need to work hard to protect our natural environment and address the global threat of climate change.</li>
					<li>We must make healthcare coverage affordable and accessible for every single American.</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
							<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What areas of public policy are you personally passionate about?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">My campaign is about creating a society where everyone has the opportunity to thrive - where individuals can work hard in well-paying jobs, where our West Michigan businesses prosper, and where families have easy access to affordable health care, housing, and education that is fundamental to human flourishing.

I have spent my adult life fighting for those who have been left out and disadvantaged. I've listened to many people's stories and have learned that we have much work to do - many of our systems are broken, unjust, and in desperate need of reimagining and repair. I am committed to making a difference.

I am also committed to making wise investments in our future - in our human capital, in our infrastructure, and in the next generation by striving to make this country just as fiscally responsible as our families and businesses must be.

No issue that we care about will advance easily unless our democracy is restored. This means that we must make the system work the way it was intended. 

Our campaign finance system is broken and in many ways responsible for the polarization and dysfunction in our politics today. I believe that money in politics too often skews decisions toward those who have power and influence. 

I believe that efforts such as gerrymandering and limiting access to the ballot are inconsistent with who we are as Americans, and must change. I will fight for a democracy where every American can participate.</p>

Unfortunately, my grandfather was a victim of the 1968 Farmington Mine Disaster and my grandmother was left as a single mother in a new country, whose language she was still learning.  She raised her children on small social security checks, earned her GED, and put herself through nursing school to save for her retirement.  She was the American Dream, and she has inspired me to champion for all Americans, regardless of their origin.</p>

					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What qualities does the U.S. House of Representatives possess that makes it unique as an institution?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">What would make the U.S. House of Representatives unique is if it were truly a House of Representatives.  With the 2018 elections, we saw the average age of Representatives drop, the gender become more female (still not enough!) and more diversity in general.  We should continue to move in the direction of true representation, so that it is full of members who face the same struggles as their average constituents.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Do you believe that it's beneficial for representatives to have previous experience in government or politics?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">There should be no ""appropriate"" path for becoming a representative in your district.  A representative should be a typical member of their community with a drive to lead change and advocate for their constituents.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What do you perceive to be the United States’ greatest challenges as a nation over the next decade?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Fighting for true equality despite the strong xenophobic messages spread by our current administration and media.  Seeing beyond the messages from powerful monetary influences, and fighting for what is best for The People.  Fighting to protect our environment from the Climate Emergency which we have caused.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">If you are not a current representative, are there certain committees that you would want to be a part of?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Financial Services Committee.  My experience in the Financial Sector has given me insight into regulations that need to be strengthened, updated, reinstated, andalso  how the industry can remove its risk from the taxpayers and everyday constituents.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Do you believe that two years is the right term length for representatives?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Yes</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What are your thoughts on term limits?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I am 100% for 12 year term limits on every member of the U.S. House of Representatives, the U.S. Senate, and for all Supreme Court Justices. 12 years is most likely two terms of the same president, then one term of a new president, likely of a different party.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What process do you favor for redistricting?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Independent redistricting commissions</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">If you are not currently a member of your party’s leadership in the U.S. House of Representatives, would you be interested in joining the leadership? If so, in what role?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I would like to use my experience in the Financial Sector to be on the Financial Services Committee.  I would like to represent my constituents rather than the banks in this position, as many members accept Corporate PAC dollars from big bank PACs and their decisions reflect their donors.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Is there a particular representative, past or present, whom you want to model yourself after?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Although I have immense respect for #TheSquad, I would like to bring my whole self and life experience to this role so that I can best represent my constituents.  My service will be unique to me and my district.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Both sitting representatives and candidates for office hear many personal stories from the residents of their district. Is there a story that you’ve heard that you found particularly touching, memorable, or impactful?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">A man with cerebral palsy reached out to me after I appeared in an interview and thanked me for raising awareness for disability rights because ""he has never seen a politician do so."" I am saddened by this, but it makes me fight harder for those who have been ignored by their representatives.</p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">What would be your top three priorities, if elected?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Transforming our healthcare system
Giving back to our veterans
Protecting our digital privacy</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What areas of public policy are you personally passionate about?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I have worked in the healthcare field for most of my career.  I am passionate about policies that put patients at the center of the healthcare system.  Additionally, I am deeply concerned about the erosion of our personal privacy. Technology has transformed our lives making difficult tasks simple, but it has come at the cost of our privacy. There are so many negative things that can be done with our data, and we should have significant control over it.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Who do you look up to? Whose example would you like to follow, and why?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I admire and respect Senator John McCain. He was a true public service; he was pragmatic in his policy; he worked across the aisle; and he stood firm when he needed to.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What characteristics or principles are most important for an elected official?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">A servant's heart, dedication to constituents, integrity, honesty, and transparency are vitally important for elected leaders.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What do you believe are the core responsibilities for someone elected to this office?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">A core responsibility is to serve your constituents, which means reading bills before you vote on them, listening to all sides of an issue, and putting people over party.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What is the first historical event that happened in your lifetime that you remember? How old were you at the time?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">It wasn't the first event in my lifetime, but it's the first I remember most vividly, the Oklahoma City bombing. I turned 13 days before the bombing, and I was home sick from school that day. I watched it unfold in real time. As a young girl, I couldn't understand how someone could be so evil or hate others so much.  That instead of trying to change the world and the things in it that concern you that you would instead turn to violence. Since that day I've watched too many acts of violence unfold in real-time; I think we all have.  It is no less sickening then it was that day, and it speaks to larger problems within our country that need to be addressed.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What was your very first job? How long did you have it?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I got my first job at 15 at a fabric store.  I worked weekends and a few evenings after school.  I've been working ever since.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What is your favorite holiday? Why?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">It is definitely Christmas. Christmas was a huge holiday for my family, with my mom ensuring it was special every year, even when money was tight.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What is your favorite book? Why?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Fiction - the Harry Potter series: great writing, a story of good overcoming evil, and it transports you to another world.
Non-fiction - Hillbilly Elegy: great view into a much misunderstood culture within our country</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What qualities does the U.S. House of Representatives possess that makes it unique as an institution?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">It was organized to be a deliberative body that discusses issues and works together to build policy that supports everyone.  In recent years, the House has lost this deliberative quality, instead becoming incredibly partisan, but it can be great again with the right leadership in place.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Do you believe that it's beneficial for representatives to have previous experience in government or politics?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I believe we need representatives from across a broad spectrum of careers that bring differing viewpoints to the table. However, the space between good ideas and policy is great, and we need representatives who understand how to craft policy with a view towards avoiding unintended consequences.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">If you are not a current representative, are there certain committees that you would want to be a part of?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I would serve on the Veteran's Affairs committee, because I believe the VA needs more transparency and stronger oversight.  I would also serve on Energy and Commerce to work towards fixing our healthcare system.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What are your thoughts on term limits?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I strongly support term limits. Serving in congress is a privilege, not a guaranteed job for life. But we must be thoughtful about how long the term limits are.  If they are too short then very little will get done and individuals will not want to serve.  If they are too long, we will have the same issues we have now.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What process do you favor for redistricting?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Maryland is an incredibly gerrymandered state.  Unfortunately, gerrymandering disenfranchises voters.  Technology affords us the opportunity to use data to draw lines that are fair to everyone.  I believe we should use sophisticated data models to draw reasonable districts.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Is there a particular representative, past or present, whom you want to model yourself after?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Representative Elise Stefanik - she has worked across the aisle and believes as I do that congress is not intended to be a lifelong position.</p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">Who are you? Tell us about yourself in 300 words or less.</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Sandra Whitten is the image of the all-American Woman. Sandra is a Mother, Wife and Friend of the community. She understands the hardships of people on the border and is subjected to the stigma of an inter-racial family. She grasps the need for real change in District 28 as well as the needs of Texans and Americans she will be fighting for in Congress. 
Before running, Sandra has been a stay at home mother to her and her husband's four children, a church leader, manager, truck sales-woman, government liaison for project management in a shipyard, baseball coach and little league board member, dance instructor and many other things, all of her experiences have allowed her to have different views on a wide-array of industries and life. Recently, Sandra has been described as a ""Rising Texas Conservative Star and Liberty Warrior"" her message is that we can no long be silent and lose our freedoms, we must stand up and fight, we must be bold to hold Texas and we must restore the heart back to our nation! It will all start with Texas!

						    <div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Please list below 3 key messages of your campaign. What are the main points you want voters to remember about your goals for your time in office?</p>
				<ul class=""key-messages"">
					<li>There is a problem on the Southern Border that is not being addressed, we must secure it! Sex and Human trafficking is real.</li>
					<li>Healthcare - Health Insurance, the care isn't the problem, the ability to PAY for it is the real issue.</li>
					<li>Getting back to the Constitution - Quit Making Politics social issues!</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
							<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What areas of public policy are you personally passionate about?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">While there are many issues that must be addressed, it is important to me that we stop trying to solve all of the social issues in federal government. It is vital that we scale back the issues that are on Capital Hill and quit micro-managing, the States must be allowed to govern without BIG Government getting in the way. 
We must cut back Federal Spending, our tax-dollars are not the solution to all of the world's problems. Access spending is causing our hard working American citizens to foot the bill for things that we shouldn't be paying for. 
Healthcare was never a constitutional right, we keep trying to make it one. We are taxing citizens for not having health insurance, that they cannot afford! We have to cut out all of the lobbyists, big pharmaceuticals and over-reaching insurance companies. Get them off of the Hill and get them to regulate costs of treatments and medicines so that people can afford their care without going bankrupt. 
Border Security is more than just stopping people from entering our Country illegally, it is about cracking down on Sex and Human trafficking, Drug trafficking and taking care of Americans. We want legal migration, we are a Country of immigrants, but we are also a Country of law and order. Illegal immigration hurts everyone. Here on the Southern Border we feel and see the effects of it the most. 
Our Veterans need our support! It is our duty to them after they have served us. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Who do you look up to? Whose example would you like to follow, and why?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">My Grandfather, Lyle D. Hoy. He was a solid example of love for God, Country and Family. He was always fair about the facts. He was quick to listen and slow to speak so that he could have as much information before giving his thoughts on a matter. He was a strong pillar in our family and community, everyone knew they could count on him for fair advice, an ear to listen to them and a hand to help with anything. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Is there a book, essay, film, or something else you would recommend to someone who wants to understand your political philosophy?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">HBO did a short series on John Adams that was really inspiring. Another one that has always put a fire in my belly is called \""Williamsburg - The Story of a Patriot\"". I also would encourage the Federalist Papers and the Constitution. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What characteristics or principles are most important for an elected official?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Admitting when they are wrong, being a fair and honest listener, putting the needs of others before themselves, and never willing to compromise on truth over emotions. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What qualities do you possess that you believe would make you a successful officeholder?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I am fair and always listen to both sides of an issue and see how we can work together to the common goal. I am firm in my answers, but am quick to admit when I am wrong. These are necessary to be able to make fair decisions about what is important to the people of our district. I am hard working and do not quit until a job is done. I always stand up for those who do not have a voice and make sure that the right thing is done.   </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What do you believe are the core responsibilities for someone elected to this office?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Service and dedication to the people. Meeting them where they are and being the voice for all of the district and not just some of the district. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What legacy would you like to leave?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I want people to be able to say \""she was a fighter that truly had a heart of the people\"". I want people to know that I always had the people of our District, State and Nation first. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What is the first historical event that happened in your lifetime that you remember? How old were you at the time?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Desert Storm, I was 10. Living in a military town we always had big celebrations when our service men and women would leave and come home. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What was your very first job? How long did you have it?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Arby's Customer Service - I started when I was 16 and was there for 2 years.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What is your favorite book? Why?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">The Hunger Games - It is the story of people held under oppression from a government that took control, but the heart of the people prevailed. The people that no one expected stepped up and changed everything, not because they had all of the answers, but because they knew they had to save the people. It is a story showing that socialism can never work, and that government should never have all of the power, the power belongs to the people. </p>

					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">If you could be any fictional character, who would you want to be?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Given my favorite book is the Hunger Games, Katniss Everdeen. She never gave up, even when the odds were not in her favor. She fought for the people, at all costs. </p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">What was the last song that got stuck in your head?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">She's Like Texas - Josh Abbott Band</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What is something that has been a struggle in your life?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I don't really count things as a struggle, I count them as an opportunity to grow, learn and never give up. From the time I was young I have always had obstacles and challenges, but I never let them hold me down. I used those moments to become the woman I am today. I am far from perfect, but I can truly say I have never lost hope or passion, I allow those moments to give me fire and passion for my work, family and keep my focus on God's calling in my life. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What qualities does the U.S. House of Representatives possess that makes it unique as an institution?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">The U.S. House of Representatives is unlike any other in the world. We take elected men and women from all walks of life, from every part of the Country and give them an equal voice. We allow them to be the voice for their district in the workings of our Country at large in matters all over the Nation and World. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Do you believe that it's beneficial for representatives to have previous experience in government or politics?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">No. I believe that elected officials who do not have a lifetime of government or politics gives We The People a real voice. People who have held offices for too long end up getting more of a sense of \""power\"" and not lose the sense of service that they were elected to do. By keeping the same people in office, too often,  turns into the \""favor-system\"" that corrupts government and the ability for people to lose faith in the system. Term Limits are Vital to keep our government healthy!</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What do you perceive to be the United States’ greatest challenges as a nation over the next decade?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Socialism. This is a cancer that is sweeping across our Nation and will be its doom. We must stick to the guiding principals of the constitution, and make smaller government and big people. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">If you are not a current representative, are there certain committees that you would want to be a part of?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">National Security, Veteran's Affairs or Foreign Affairs. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Do you believe that two years is the right term length for representatives?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I believe that the Founding Fathers knew that 2 year limits were fair for a reason, and being a strong supporter of the constitution, that is what we need to stick with. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What are your thoughts on term limits?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I firmly agree with term limits! It would make elected officials more accountable and do away with the \""seniority-system\"".</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Is there a particular representative, past or present, whom you want to model yourself after?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Jim Jordan and Trey Growdy are two men who I greatly admire. They have boldness and convection and a passion for fairness, truth and taking the \""game\"" out of politics. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Both sitting representatives and candidates for office hear many personal stories from the residents of their district. Is there a story that you’ve heard that you found particularly touching, memorable, or impactful?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I have met many amazing and wonderful people on this journey in our district. Southerland Springs is an amazing place full of the most genuine and humble people on the planet. 2 years ago the church there had a mass shooting, many of the people from their church I have the honor of now calling my friends. To just tell one story would be unfair to all of them. By far they have impacted me the most. The people of our district are full of some of the most amazing stories and lives and yet they have felt silenced for too long. I want to be able to bring life, and breath to the stories of our people. I want to give them the platform to tell their stories and let the rest of the Country know what District 28 is all about. </p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">Who are you? Tell us about yourself in 300 words or less.</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Hi, I'm Kim Nelson and I'm running for Congress in South Carolina's 4th District. I'm from right here in the Upstate and call Greer home along with my husband David, daughters Brett and Nora, and our rescue pets Ichabod and Balto. This is our home and that's why it's so important for me to step up and fight for my family and yours.

Everyday, people are going bankrupt because they can't afford their own or their family's medical care, meanwhile, insurance and pharmaceutical companies are reporting record profits. Our environment is crumbling around us -- guaranteeing that our children will be presented with yet another insurmountable problem to solve because we weren't willing to take a stand.

Enough is enough. It's time for someone to stand up to corporate interests and fight for the working-class folks right here in the Upstate.

This isn't going to be an easy fight. It's going to require our collective energies as we knock on doors, make phone calls, register new voters, and ensure that the voices of the majority are finally heard in this district. 

I'm ready to fight -- are you?

				<ul class=""key-messages"">
					<li>Healthcare is a human right and I'm ready to bring my experience in health policy and public health to Congress. Our current healthcare system doesn't work for anyone except insurance and pharmaceutical executives. People are dying because they can't afford care, and that's unacceptable to me. I will fight to decrease the cost of prescription drugs and make sure that every American has access to healthcare.   </li>
					<li>From our mountains to our coast, South Carolina is a place of immense natural beauty and resources. I want to preserve our home for future generations, and that means getting real on climate breakdown and holding corporations accountable for the damage they have done to our environment. If we do this right, we can also make sure that the Upstate is a leader in high-paying green energy jobs.</li>
					<li>I am ready to stand up to corporations and fight for the American working class. That means making sure that corporations are paying their fair share in taxes, raising the federal minimum wage, guaranteeing paid family leave, and closing the gender-wage gap. That also means providing relief for the millions of Americans with student debt and ensuring that every American has access to affordable college education.</li>

				<p class=""survey-question"">What areas of public policy are you personally passionate about?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Securing our borders--There is a border crisis that is making our communities less safe and less prosperous. I will fight to end the flood of illegal labor and cut off the drugs flowing in from our southern border.

Taking care of our homeless veterans--As Congressman, I will ensure Washington is responsible for the homeless crisis by taking action to care for our veterans, helping the mentally ill and protecting our communities.

Keep violent criminals behind bars--To combat rising crime, I know we must ensure violent criminals stay behind bars where they belong. But I also believe we must focus on stopping crime before it starts, by prioritizing after-school programs and high-tech vocational programs that are proven and effective at preventing our youth from entering a life a crime.

Keep jobs in California--Small businesses are the backbone of the American economy. As the only candidate for CA-45 who has actually created jobs as a small-business owner, I know how to cut red tape and help generate good-paying jobs for Orange County residents and keep companies from fleeing to friendlier states.

No budget, no pay for Congress--Congress shouldn't be rewarded for failure. As your Representative, I will not take a paycheck if Congress does not pass a budget.</p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">Who are you? Tell us about yourself in 300 words or less.</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Sean McCaffity was raised in Garland with a Texas work ethic, middle-class values, and a family rooted in faith.

 He was raised by his dad, a print production manager, and mom, a bookkeeper. Sean had a typical Texas childhood. He sang in the church choir and went to public schools. He found his passion in debate, where he learned to love public policy and exploring the issues facing our nation. When Sean got into Northwestern University, his family dug deep to help him afford tuition: his parents cashed in retirement savings, while Sean earned a debate scholarship and took out thousands in student loans. Sean went on to become a two-time national debate champion, and never forgot the sacrifices his parents made for him to follow his dreams.

Sean went to Baylor University School of Law and dedicated his career to standing up for the little guy, taking on shady businesses who exploited and swindled families and seniors.

He's committed to bringing people together to solve our biggest challenges: to bolster our democracy, ensure everyone can afford to see a doctor when they're sick, strengthen every school across Texas, help Texas businesses create jobs for Texans, and invest in our roads and bridges.

Sean lives in Lucas with his wife and three daughters.</p>

Developing and installing renewable sources and energy storage systems will create reliable energy that doesn’t take us to war or keep us dependent on sources that will run out and pollute our air. The investment we make now will help us continue to save on our utility bills for decades to come.</p></li>
					<li><p>People who volunteer to serve in our military have to be treated with the dignity and respect they deserve. They should be paid a living wage when enlisted, and given the best available medical treatment during and after their service to our country. When I’m elected, I’ll make sure millions of dollars in funds meant for military families and veterans in CD5 aren’t diverted to a vanity border-wall project.</p></li>

				<p class=""survey-question"">What areas of public policy are you personally passionate about?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I owned and operated a small business providing midwifery services to growing families in the Pikes Peak region; as a women's healthcare provider, I know firsthand what works in our healthcare system and where we can make improvements. I support reducing what Americans spend by championing universal healthcare, allowing the re-importation of prescription drugs, and streamlining the entire industry.  I will protect the privacy and reproductive rights of all Americans, including the right to abortion.  I will fight until every person has high-quality healthcare that we can be proud of as a country. 

Under my leadership, we will:

Decrease VA wait times and increase number of facilities
Eliminate deductibles and co-pays
Decrease prescription drug costs
Increase access to mental healthcare and addiction services
Protect privacy and reproductive rights
Reduce healthcare bureaucracy and make all doctors in-network
Increase access to home healthcare
Increase access to preventative care
Streamline disability services and ensure people get the assistance and care they need
Improve access to healthcare services in rural areas</p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">Who do you look up to? Whose example would you like to follow, and why?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Representative Katie Porter is a role model for all aspiring leaders;  she is a single mom to three kids, working hard in Congress to hold people accountable for their actions and ensure that our government reflects our country's diversity.   She is whip smart,  constantly shows her integrity, and keeps a sense of humor through it all. </p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">What was your very first job? How long did you have it?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I started as a bagger at a large midwestern grocery store chain when I was fourteen.  Over the course of my high school career I advanced to cashier, and then the customer service desk.  I also cross-trained in the bakery, the floral department, and was  the first woman to insist that I was strong enough to bring in carts.  This job taught me the value (and struggle!) of  customer service, fostered an ability to work as a team, and kept gas in my truck.  </p>

Invest in a reliable renewable energy infrastructure that lowers utility bills

Create jobs in the renewable energy sector, including for veterans re-entering the civilian workforce

Ensure that individuals transitioning out of fossil fuel industries have access to education to enter a new field or early retirement with full pension

Invest in public transportation infrastructure and electrify personal vehicles

Improve construction standards to ensure new builds are energy efficient and generate at least a portion of their own electricity, as well as creating programs to encourage energy efficiency improvements in existing buildings

Extend and expand federal rebate programs for rooftop solar to include on-site batteries and energy efficient appliances

Expand energy efficiency education programs</p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">Who are you? Tell us about yourself in 300 words or less.</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Disabled/Retired Marine First Sergeant and retired Federal employee.  Served over 35 years in various agencies in the Intelligence Community, including over 15 years as both a counterterrorism analyst and Middle East Subject Matter Expert. 

As a youth, my family was poor so, in order to attend a Catholic high school, I had to earn the money for tuition, myself.  So, I started my working when I turned 14 and paid for not only my high school tuition but also completed my graduate degree without going into debt.

I have been married for 34 years, have 4 children and two grandchildren.</p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">Please list below 3 key messages of your campaign. What are the main points you want voters to remember about your goals for your time in office?</p>
				<ul class=""key-messages"">
					<li>Every American deserves the opportunity for a financially secure life.</li>
					<li>Education is the only way to achieve real opportunity in America.</li>
					<li>We must have  vocational technical high schools to teach the trades to youth who may otherwise not graduate.</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
							<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What areas of public policy are you personally passionate about?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I am most passionate about equal opportunity for everyone, not necessarily equal outcomes.  The only way to offer equal opportunity is through education.  Children must be able to receive a high quality education without regard to their ethnicity or economic status.  Any child assigned to an unaccredited school, must have the right to choose the school they want to attend, even a private school.  School choice will guarantee that schools compete for students, increasing the quality of education in their school districts.

Furthermore, many students have no intention of attending college; many of them leave school before graduation. To get the graduation rate up and help students develop marketable skills in the trades, we need Vocational Technical high schools.  More students will enjoy going to school; they'll be learning trades, knowing they will have marketable skills when they graduate, so most will stay in school until graduation and then be able to get good paying jobs.  This will not only reduce poverty, but also reduce the number of young people becoming criminals.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Who do you look up to? Whose example would you like to follow, and why?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I have had the good fortune of having a number of men who have influenced me in my life.  One in particular was Jim Buckley, from Bridgewater, MA.  In early 2002, Jim died at age 97.  His entire life was one of service and love for his fellow man. What I remember most about Jim is a phrase that he emphasized to everyone he met; that is, \""to know one is to love one.\""  As a teen, Jim would tell me that all people are different and I should treat everyone with love, even if they acted differently than I was. 

Even when he met people who were prejudiced, he would talk to them, explaining that we're all made in God's image and none of have any reason to hate; only to love, as God loves each of us.

Since meeting Jim when I was about 12 years old, I have treated everyone I meet with dignity and respect, without regard to any differences that may exist between us.  Even today, I have a number of friends with whom I disagree on political and social issues but we have honest conversation, respecting each other's views.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Is there a book, essay, film, or something else you would recommend to someone who wants to understand your political philosophy?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">My political philosophy has been influenced by the history of the United States, not a single book, essay, or film.  As a student of history, I read everything that I can find on any historical events in the U.S.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What characteristics or principles are most important for an elected official?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Integrity is most important.  We live in a country where Americans expect candidates to lie so they can get elected; sometimes I think even when the lies are obvious, voters will ignore them as long as they hear what they want.  Sadly, many Americans have historically voted for incumbents based on new promises, not previous successes.

Honor is vital for anyone in positions of authority.  If an incumbent (or challenger, for that matter) is asked for help because a candidate for another office assaulted that person - or committed any crime - it's imperative that the  incumbent (or challenger) immediately report the allegation to law enforcement.  This happened in this District and the incumbent did absolutely nothing because he wanted to ensure the accused won his election.  The incumbent, Congressman Bobby Scott, puts politics over his personal honor.

Justice is another important principle.  Without justice, we cannot treat everyone fairly and impartially.  Every American must always be treated with dignity and respect, even when accused of misdeeds.  Otherwise, we'll have a populace that believes an accused person is guilty or innocent, based solely on their political ideology, not the facts.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What do you believe are the core responsibilities for someone elected to this office?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">1. Ensuring the annual budgets are passed on time and funding only items contained within the Constitution or directly benefits the American people.
2. Assisting their constituents in applying for government benefits for which they're eligible, particularly Veterans Administration and Social Security benefits.
3, Actively participating in oversight hearings, asking difficult, adversarial questions, even when questioning employees of the Executive Branch that is in the same political party of the Congressman.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What is the first historical event that happened in your lifetime that you remember? How old were you at the time?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I vaguely remember the landing on the moon, when I was about 6 years old.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What was your very first job? How long did you have it?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">My first job was working at my church so I could go to a Catholic high school.  I started working by answering phones and by the end of my Freshman year in high school, I was helping with all aspects of maintenance for five buildings in my parish, as well as working in the parish cemetery. I continued working there throughout high school and left when I joined the Marine Corps.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What is your favorite book? Why?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I don't really have a favorite book but I really enjoy books concerning American history and the history of U.S. Intelligence.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">If you could be any fictional character, who would you want to be?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Superman.  I believe in \""Truth, Justice, and the American Way.\""  With the American Way being equal opportunity for everyone, without regard to race, religion, ethnicity, gender, or any other discriminator.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What was the last song that got stuck in your head?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Amazing Grace was stuck in my head for nearly six weeks when my son was in a coma, as a result of chemotherapy.  I heard it and hummed it constantly the entire time he was fighting for his life.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What is something that has been a struggle in your life?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">The biggest struggle in my life has been living and caring for family members with severe disabilities.  When I was 8 years old my mother was diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis and her condition deteriorated very quickly until she had to start using a wheelchair.  When I was 10, she started losing the use of her hands and couldn't move herself in her wheelchair.  During the summer, I would push my mother to the park so we could go swimming; my sisters would walk with our younger siblings.

Later in life, we had a son with Downs Syndrome who also survived leukemia. Although he's 15 years old, his mental capacity is about that of a two year old.  Every day is a challenge but we have learned so much about caring for him, the help that's available, and the many false perceptions of the help that is available to people in this situation.  Additionally, not every intellectually disabled child can or should be mainstreamed into classes with non disabled students.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What qualities does the U.S. House of Representatives possess that makes it unique as an institution?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">The House of Representatives is unique in the fact that it was designed to have consistent turnover, giving average Americans a voice in their governance.  This was to ensure the average Americans were well represented when the House of Representatives drafted bills concerning taxation. It was also meant to ensure that anytime war was declared, it was done so by the direct representatives of the American people.

Unfortunately, we now have a House of Representatives that represents the parties rather than their constituents.  This needs to change; I believe that Term Limits is the only way to get it back to the way it was intended.</p>

					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Do you believe that it's beneficial for representatives to have previous experience in government or politics?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">It's definitely better to have some experience in the matters that could come before you. For instance, my experience in the Intelligence Community will make my questioning of witnesses more effective than someone who has had none.  More important than experience is to have the trust of one's constituents to do the right thing on their behalf, not what's politically convenient.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What do you perceive to be the United States’ greatest challenges as a nation over the next decade?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Our greatest challenge is to return to being Americans first with party affiliation being secondary.  It seems that no matter the issue, as soon as one politician makes a statement about that issue, the other party will immediately reject any support as wrong.  The opposition party to the President always seems to fight anything he proposes, even when they have previously proposed the exact same thing.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">If you are not a current representative, are there certain committees that you would want to be a part of?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Intelligence Committee 
Homeland Security Committee 
Education </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">If you are a current representative, why did you join your current committees?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">N/A</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Do you believe that two years is the right term length for representatives?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Yes. I also believe in term limits. I believe that a Congressman should serve no more than three 2-year terms.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What are your thoughts on term limits?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I have signed a pledge to co-sponsor legislation to enact term limits for both houses of Congress.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">If you are not currently a member of your party’s leadership in the U.S. House of Representatives, would you be interested in joining the leadership? If so, in what role?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Yes.  Wherever I can have the most positive impact for the country.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Is there a particular representative, past or present, whom you want to model yourself after?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Walter Jones, (R-NC), who passed away shortly after I decided to run.  I knew him and provided his staff with the information to remove restrictions on disabled veterans receiving both VA disability compensation and military retirement pay.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Both sitting representatives and candidates for office hear many personal stories from the residents of their district. Is there a story that you’ve heard that you found particularly touching, memorable, or impactful?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">The most common comments have to do with the quality of education, especially for students who don't want or can't attend college.  Many young adults have commented that they wish they could have an opportunity to learn a trade in high school.  As adults, many have to compete for apprenticeship programs but those in poverty often don't have access to transportation to participate, if selected.</p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">Who are you? Tell us about yourself in 300 words or less.</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">First-generation American citizen, Mike Garcia is a highly decorated United States Naval Officer whose record-setting flying performance earned him the honor of becoming one of the first Super Hornet strike fighter pilots in the Navy. He flew over 30 combat missions during Operation Iraqi freedom. 

Accruing over 1400 hours of operational flight time during his nearly 20 years of military service to our country, Garcia decided to separate from the US Navy with an Honorable Discharge to focus on his family. Garcia moved back to the 25th District in 2009 and began to work for the Raytheon Company.

During his now 10 years as an executive at Raytheon, Garcia has been responsible for the generation of billions of dollars of revenue and the creation of hundreds of jobs for his company and our district. 

Garcia is the husband to Rebecca Garcia, the owner of the Rebecca Rollins Interiors in Santa Clarita, and the father of Preston (age 13) and Jett (age 3).

				<p class=""survey-question"">Please list below 3 key messages of your campaign. What are the main points you want voters to remember about your goals for your time in office?</p>
				<ul class=""key-messages"">
					<li>Garcia will make it a priority to ensure our men and women in uniform have the funding and tools necessary to keep America safe, and only send them into battle when it is absolutely necessary</li>
					<li>Garcia supports term limits because it's time to get rid of the career politicians in both parties. Washington, DC truly is a swamp, filled with career politicians who are more concerned with their next election than making tough decisions.</li>
					<li>Mike Garcia is a first-generation American citizen whose family came to the United States legally for more opportunity and for a shot at the American Dream. Garcia knows what's at stake, and he'll fight against Democrats' dangerous socialist agenda and restore our country's guiding principles, most importantly freedom, that he helped protect in his 20 years as a Naval Officer.</li>
