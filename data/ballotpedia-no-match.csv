				<p class=""survey-question"">Who are you? Tell us about yourself in 300 words or less.</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Tom Watson is a lifelong Texan and veteran of the Vietnam War who has a deep desire to serve his community. 

He has been married for 51 years to his wife, Amanda, who is an ordained priest in the Epsicopal Church. Since 2005, Tom has practiced law with his daughter and son-in-law in Abilene.

Tom believes our local leaders should be loyal to their voters and constituents rather than a political party. He feels our current civil servants are more interested in maintaining their personal power and influence rather than helping West Texans who voted them into office. 
</p>
			</div>
						    <div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Please list below 3 key messages of your campaign. What are the main points you want voters to remember about your goals for your time in office?</p>
				<ul class=""key-messages"">
					<li>We must end the trade wars and ensure our farmers and ranchers have access to international markets.</li>
					<li>West Texas should lead the US in renewable energy. We must invest in infrastructure and increase wind and solar energy production in our district.</li>
					<li>The minimum wage must be increased so all Americans can afford to pay rent and raise families while working full-time.</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
							<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What areas of public policy are you personally passionate about?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I grew up on a small, cotton farm in Texas and understand what our farmers and ranchers go through everyday. As a lawyer in Abilene, I see the struggles of many of my neighbors as they try to get adequate healthcare for their families and education for their children.  

I am personally passionate about improving lives in our rural communities. 

Our neighbors should not be told to move to larger cities to receive the care and schooling they deserve. Rather, we should build stronger infrastructure and encourage coordination between larger municipalities and smaller, rural towns in order to have thriving communities where all West Texans can prosper.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What qualities do you possess that you believe would make you a successful officeholder?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I care about all members of my community. I am running for office to serve all West Texans, not only the ones who donate to my campaign or even vote for me, but every person living in my district.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What do you believe are the core responsibilities for someone elected to this office?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Above all, public servants need to serve all members of their community, not a select few.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Do you believe that it's beneficial for representatives to have previous experience in government or politics?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I believe it is important that representatives understand sacrifice and leadership. My opponent has never been in a situation where he has had to forgo his own paycheck in order to take care of his employees who rely on him. I know what it means to put others before myself and to recognize my areas of privilege. While serving in Congress, I will put the interests of the voters before the interests of my party and donors. </p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">What would be your top three priorities, if elected?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">My first priority is maintaining the finest level of constituent service that the people I represent have come to expect from my office.  Earlier this year, I was honored by the non-partisan Congressional Management Foundation as one of the top six offices in all of Congress for """"outstanding constituent service."""" As a small business owner who ran a successful service department for decades before being elected, I take great pride in applying the lessons I learned in the private sector to my congressional office to provide the highest level of constituent service possible.

Second, I will ensure that the pro-growth policies that are currently fueling our nation's historic economic resurgence are kept fully intact. These polices have produced lower taxes, higher wages, record-low unemployment, and more job openings than ever before. We must protect these achievements. This includes preserving the new tax cuts for middle-income families and small businesses, rolling back more job-killing regulations, and working with the Trump administration to formulate the strongest possible trade deals that put American workers first. Our country's recent economic growth will only continue if pro-growth Republican legislators maintain control of the U.S. House of Representatives. It is only through a strong and robust economy that we can build stronger communities and fully fund important programs like Social security and Medicare, which rely on wage taxes from working men and women to be solvent.

My third priority is protecting Social Security and Medicare for seniors and reducing health care costs for all Americans.  As a member of the Ways and Means Committee, I was able to successfully delay the implementation of the unfair """"Cadillac Tax"""" on employer-provided health care benefits enjoyed by 178 million middle-income Americans, including unionized workers. But that is not enough. It is my goal to permanently eliminate this harmful tax, and my bill to do so has earned the support of more than 300 co-sponsors.  With that kind of overwhelming bi-partisan support, if re-elected, I believe we will accomplish our goal.  Also, American families and seniors are still struggling with unaffordable drug costs, which is why I sponsored legislation that will make low-cost generic drugs more easily available.  No senior should have to decide between buying food and purchasing the drugs that they have been prescribed to stay healthy. Pursuing policies that lower health care costs will continue to be a priority for me if I am re-elected.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What areas of public policy are you personally passionate about?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">As a small businessman, father, and grandfather who has spent his entire career in the private sector growing a business and meeting payroll for over 100 employees, delivering pro-growth economic policies for the hardworking families that I represent is my passion.  As a member Congress, I have had the privilege of serving on the influential Ways and Means Committee which has jurisdiction over so many areas that directly affect our economy and the everyday lives of the people I represent, including the tax code, trade, health care, and Social Security.  That is why I believe it is important to have representatives in Congress who understand the burden that government can place on job creators and the positive and negative effects that our trade policies can have on Western Pennsylvania's industries.  Smart pro-growth economic policy like the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2018 drives the creation of good-paying jobs for working men and women and keeps Social Security sustained for those to whom it was promised.</p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">Who are you? Tell us about yourself in 300 words or less.</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I was born in Salt Lake City, grew up in Albuquerque, NM and I've lived in Clearfield for the past 22 years.

I served nearly 9 years on the Clearfield Planning Commission before being elected to the City Council in 2007. After 6 years on the Council, I was elected as Clearfield City's Mayor in 2013 and am now in his second term in that position.

I love our military members and veterans! I served as the Honorary Commander for the 388th Maintenance Group for 3.5 years and then for the 466th Fighter Squadron for another 2.5 years. I was appointed by the Governor to serve on the Military Installation Development Authority (MIDA) which has responsibility for development of Falcon Hill at HAFB as well as other locations in Utah. I also serve as a Board member on the Utah Defense Alliance. I just completed my second term as the Chairman of the Military Communities Council for the National League of Cities where I meet regularly with Mayors from across the nation whose communities are adjacent to a military installation.

I've been married to my wife Tammie for the past 31 years. We are the parents of seven children and three grandchildren. In my ""spare"" time, you'll likely find me  at a Real Salt Lake soccer game, searching for my ball at one of the local golf courses or at the gun range. Whichever activity that day might bring, you will almost always find one of my children by my side. </p>

						    <div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Please list below 3 key messages of your campaign. What are the main points you want voters to remember about your goals for your time in office?</p>
				<ul class=""key-messages"">
					<li>We must get our budget in line and reduce the ever-growing deficit. We need to look at every dollar we are spending and make difficult cuts to make this happen. I will bring Utah's fiscally conservative values to Washington.</li>
					<li>I will defend Hill AFB at the highest levels and advocate for future missions, our active duty military and our veterans. Hill is the Utah's largest single-site employer and a $3.9B economic engine for northern Utah. </li>
					<li>I will work to find a fair solution to stop the rising costs of healthcare and education and present solutions to reduce the growing student debt.</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
							<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What areas of public policy are you personally passionate about?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">We have an infrastructure problem. As a Mayor, I understand the desperate need to reimagine and modernize the nation's infrastructure. With thousands of jobs set to come to northern Utah, we must address this now, not later. We must ensure we have the means to provide roads, utilities and other infrastructure to meet the growing demand. I will support legislation that will provide a comprehensive infrastructure package and reward those cities and states who provide innovative solutions. 

We have an immigration problem, but we are also a nation of immigrants. The nation was founded by immigrants and enriched by the diversity of its immigrants, many of whom have come here to escape religious persecution, war, genocide, and tyranny in hopes of sharing in freedom and prosperity through hard work. We must find balance between the obligation to protect our borders and the citizens of this nation and the ideals the Statue of Liberty represents. 

We are at a crossroads in American history around the future of work. The pace of change is rapid, and we must examine the trends shaping the workforce of tomorrow, including artificial intelligence and automation, the changing models around freedom and flexibility in the workplace and the impact of the gig economy. The skill transitions are going to be quite substantial, and many will lack the skills necessary to thrive in a changing workplace. We need to de-stigmatize the trades to ensure we have a skilled workforce. 


</p>

					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Who do you look up to? Whose example would you like to follow, and why?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">There are a myriad of people, both famous and not who have inspired me through the years. From a political standpoint, Lincoln is my hero, but I could also put Jefferson in that class. Lincoln was a great example of leadership through crisis, and his response to the crisis shaped the future of the nation. 

Outside of the political world, there are two men, one historical and the other fictional, who shaped my life. The first was the priest from Victor Hugo's 'Les Miserables.' When Jean Valjean was caught stealing from the priest, he could have been sent back to jail for the rest of his life, but the priest not only refused to condemn him for stealing his silverware, he gave him his candlesticks. This one action changed the trajectory of Jean Valjean's life and gave him hope. The priest cared about the individual. I read that book when I was 18 years old, and his example changed the trajectory of my life as well. It instilled in me a desire to focus on the individual and to do good to those around me. 

The second was Viktor Frankl who wrote 'Man's search for meaning.' While he spoke  in depth about our ability to choose our response to stimulus, he also spoke about responsibility. When we have liberty, we also have responsibility. We have a responsibility to lift others and to care for that which provides us our liberty - the nation in which we live.  Viktor added to my sense of responsibility to serve others and to give back in the form of public service. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Is there a book, essay, film, or something else you would recommend to someone who wants to understand your political philosophy?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Les Miserables' by Victor Hugo  and 'Man's Search For Meaning' by Viktor Frankl. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What characteristics or principles are most important for an elected official?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Honesty. Integrity. Serving for the right reason. 

I've been asked constantly who I am running against, and my answer is simple: no one. I am running for the principles I stand for and to support and defend the values and beliefs of those I will represent. It isn't about power or a title, it's about people. REAL people living their lives at home and expecting that their Representative has their best interest at the forefront of all he does. They need to know that he will do the things he says and fulfill the commitments he made during his campaign.

				<p class=""survey-question"">What qualities do you possess that you believe would make you a successful officeholder?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I truly care for those I serve and want to improve the lives of those around me. As a Mayor, I have told people many times that there is an old adage that elected officials use which says they want to leave the place better than when they found it. That has never been my goal. I don't want to simply leave it better as that doesn't take much of an effort. I want a complete overhaul. I want people to know when they left the previous city and entered mine. And I want them to recognize when they leave. I want my residents to have an improved quality of life than they did before I took office, and I want them to be proud of where they live. I used to do everything I could to make people happy, but it killed me to find that there was no way to make everyone happy. By making one person happy, I would inevitably make another unhappy. I decided my only option was to make sure they know I care even if I can't resolve their issue or make them happy. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What do you believe are the core responsibilities for someone elected to this office?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I believe we need someone who truly represents those who elected him; not just those who donated big dollars to the campaign, but ALL of the people. That means those  who supported him and those who may have voted for someone else. He must be reachable. I have used the same cell phone number since I was appointed to the Planning Commission. It is how people know they get in touch with me. They can call or text me, and I will respond. It is my commitment to continue to use that same phone number as a Congressman. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What is the first historical event that happened in your lifetime that you remember? How old were you at the time?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">The first historical event I remember was Watergate. I was 6 when it all began, and I hated that it was interrupting my Saturday morning cartoon watching. As things went on, I began to be interested but didn't really understand what was happening. I remember well when President Nixon came on TV and announced he was resigning, and while I didn't understand it all, I knew it was important. As I got older and started studying political science at BYU, I finally got a grasp of what had transpired in my youth. It may well be the initial spark that got me interested in public service. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What was your very first job? How long did you have it?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I can't remember a time when I didn't have a job. My parents instill in me a very strong work ethic. I paid for most of my school clothes, my first car and most of the activities I did as a kid. My very first job was delivering newspapers in Salt Lake City when I was 9 years old. I delivered to homes in the Sugarhouse area and to Westminster College. I did that for several years until we moved out of state. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What is your favorite book? Why?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">That is a long list to narrow down. I've mentioned Viktor Frankl's 'Man's Search For Meaning,' and it is still probably my favorite. It is a story of hope in one of the darkest points in the world's history. I often go back to a quote from that book which says \""Between stimulus and response there is a space. In that space is our power to choose our response. In our response lies our growth and our freedom.\"" This is the basis of everything I do and believe. We have the ability to choose how we respond. We are facing a global pandemic right now. Some will walk into a supermarket, see only two bags of flower on a shelf and buy them both. Someone else will buy one for themselves and leave one for someone else. Someone will by them both and give one to someone else. And someone will buy them both and make bread for their neighborhood. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What was the last song that got stuck in your head?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Uncle John's Band' by the Grateful Dead.  I am truly a 'Deadhead' at heart, and the first lyrics to this song speak to me: \""Well, the first days are the hardest days, don't you worry anymore. Cuz' when life looks like east street, there is danger at your door. Think this through with me. Let me know your mind. Oh, oh, all I want to know is 'are you kind?'
</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What qualities does the U.S. House of Representatives possess that makes it unique as an institution?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">The makeup of the House of Representatives is its most unique quality. Unlike the Senate, Representatives are elected for a 2-year period of time. This was set up so that the did not become a permanent fixture in Washington as they would need to be re-elected every two years. It allows for relatively quick change and should ensure the Representatives are in touch with those who elected them. While the system was put in place so as to not have Representatives turning the position into a career, history has shown us that that wasn't the outcome. We need to initiate term limits on both houses of Congress. I would support a limit of six terms in the House and two terms in the Senate. That would put a cap of twelve years on both houses of Congress. After twelve years,  if you have not become the solution, you have become part of the problem.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Do you believe that it's beneficial for representatives to have previous experience in government or politics?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I think that having served as an elected official shortens the learning curve for a new Representative and gives him  point of view from the local government vantage point. This is crucial knowledge for a Representative who is there to represent the cities and towns in his district. He knows how the decisions he makes will affect those at the lowest level of government. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What do you perceive to be the United States’ greatest challenges as a nation over the next decade?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Throughout the next decade, we will be faced with multiple challenges. Some of them we can foresee, and others have yet to present themselves. Underlying all of them, and the way we can and will respond to the challenges, will be the budget. We continue to function on a series of continuing resolutions in order to keep the government running. This is a concept foreign to Utah and to most other states. Constitutionally, our State, Counties and Cities must all have a balanced budget. We do the same in our businesses and families. I can't imagine running my business or my household in the way we run the Federal government. During the next 10 years, we are going to have to make some serious changes to our budget, cut programs to get closer to making ends meet and start reducing the deficit. As Mayor, we began a zero-based budgeting process. This meant that, just because the department got $1,000,000 last year, they do not get to start there this year. Every dollar has to be justified by each department. Once the budget requests have been submitted, we sit down and start making cuts until the income exceeds the expenses AND allow us to put aside for a rainy day.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">If you are not a current representative, are there certain committees that you would want to be a part of?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">My first choice would be to serve on the Armed Services Committee. I would also like to serve on Veterans Affairs, Appropriations and Homeland Security. I believe my background would allow me to contribute a great deal to any of these committees. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Do you believe that two years is the right term length for representatives?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Yes. As stated previously, the two-year term allows for a Congressional District to replace their Representative relatively quickly should he fail to live up to the commitments he made. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What are your thoughts on term limits?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I fully support term limits. The problem has been getting Congress to cast a vote which would ultimately relieve them of their position. I believe there is an answer to that. I would propose legislation which allows any sitting Congressman or Senator to remain in their position until such time as they are voted out any their constituents but puts any newly elected official under a term limit. I would propose a limit of twelve years for either house. This would allow the shift to take place over time, but ensure that all elected officials are under the new term limits within 20-30 years. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">If you are not currently a member of your party’s leadership in the U.S. House of Representatives, would you be interested in joining the leadership? If so, in what role?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Way too early for me to be thinking of joining leadership in the House. When elected, I would certainly entertain that opportunity. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Is there a particular representative, past or present, whom you want to model yourself after?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I am a huge fan of Trey Gowdy. Trey may well be one of the most conservative Representatives I have ever encountered, and yet he had the ability to bring people to the table to talk. He stated, while we are nation may seem divided on the surface, he believed that the nation can be transformed by conversations and friendships that lead to reconciliations and understanding. He held strong to his conservative principles while trying to unite us. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Both sitting representatives and candidates for office hear many personal stories from the residents of their district. Is there a story that you’ve heard that you found particularly touching, memorable, or impactful?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I spoke to a someone recently who told me about his troubled childhood. After being a witness to the death of his parents and then dealing with every form of abuse by those who raised him afterwards, he still had the ability to decide his future. He felt we, as Americans, need more of that mentality. We need to look at ourselves and commit to being better people. </p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">Who are you? Tell us about yourself in 300 words or less.</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I am a father, a successful businessman, and a conservative outsider who has never held public office. I started turning wrenches at 16, fixing and rebuilding classic cars. Now I own and operate MAR-K, the nation's leading manufacturer of over 6,000 component parts for classic automobiles and trucks.  Before acquiring MAR-K, I spent 28 years in the education, energy, manufacturing, and technology industries, including at Logic Energy Solutions, Petrosmith, and Kimray Inc.  I live in Edmond, Oklahoma with my wife of 26 years, Shannon.  I have six wonderful children, including three strong, independent daughters and three selfless sons who all serve in the Army.  I am an avid runner and I co-founded the Oklahoma City Memorial Marathon.  My wife and I also founded Providence Hall Classical Christian School (now The Academy of Classical Christian Studies).

						    <div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Please list below 3 key messages of your campaign. What are the main points you want voters to remember about your goals for your time in office?</p>
				<ul class=""key-messages"">
					<li>Congress is broken. Nancy Pelosi and the career politicians in Washington have taken us down the wrong path. They want socialized medicine, open borders, higher taxes, bigger government, and a complete elimination of our First and Second Amendment rights. They have launched a ""Green New Deal"" that threatens to shut down our energy industry and tank our entire economy.</li>
					<li>Washington politicians have made harassment, investigation, and impeachment of President Trump their top priority, ignoring American families struggling with sky-rocketing healthcare costs, facing an opioid epidemic that ravages our communities, and suffocating regulations that weigh down our economy, costing us jobs. It's bad for Oklahoma, it's bad for America, and it's time to say enough is enough.</li>
					<li>I won't go along to get along. I am not a career politician. I'm a fixer, a tough negotiator, and a leader who will fight to fix Congress. I'll answer to Oklahomans, and I'll put an end to Nancy Pelosi's crazy liberal experiment. </li>
				</ul>
			</div>
							<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What areas of public policy are you personally passionate about?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">As a manufacturer, I am passionate about rebuilding American manufacturing and creating good paying jobs for America's middle class.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Who do you look up to? Whose example would you like to follow, and why?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I look up to the men and women who serve in the U.S. Military. It is a hard life full of sacrifice. It is hard on relationships and family. Many suffer injuries and some lay down their life for their country. All three of my sons have chosen this path and I admire them greatly.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What characteristics or principles are most important for an elected official?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Honesty. Courage. Compassion.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What qualities do you possess that you believe would make you a successful officeholder?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I have built my career on assessing problems by listening to those involved and then both finding and implementing innovative solutions. That is exactly what Washington D.C. needs today.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What is the first historical event that happened in your lifetime that you remember? How old were you at the time?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">In 1972, Atari released the Pong video game. Shortly thereafter, my dad and some technicians at his work made us one. It was crude but so much fun. I didn't realize it at the time, but that seems like the birth of a new era in technology.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What was your very first job? How long did you have it?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">My first job was mowing lawns. I talked my dad into letting me use the family mower and edger and I pushed them around our neighborhood and mowed lawns. At that time, mowing and trimming a lawn was 5-20 dollars depending on the size of the yard. Eventually, I expanded the business outside the neighborhood and mowed some commercial properties as well. I even hired friends to help when it got to the point where it was more than I could do. I did this for several years along with several other jobs that I took on. It was great work and an amazing experience. This probably started a journey of loving to fix things as I had to maintain and repair the old mower and edger that I used for the business.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What is your favorite book? Why?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">The Holy Bible - throughout my life, I regularly return to it and find incredible wisdom and insight into daily problems.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Do you believe that it's beneficial for representatives to have previous experience in government or politics?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">No. In fact, we have too many \""experienced\"" politicians in Washington who spend more time worrying about their careers than their constituents. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Do you believe that two years is the right term length for representatives?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Yes</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What are your thoughts on term limits?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I support term limits. Too many politicians go to Washington and become beholden to special interests rather than honoring the voters who elected them. Term limits would force career politicians out of office, and level the playing field, so we can bring fresh ideas and new perspectives to our nation's entrenched problems.</p>

				<p class=""survey-response"">Previous experience in government and politics could be beneficial and a detriment depending on the experience gained.

				<p class=""survey-question"">Please list below 3 key messages of your campaign. What are the main points you want voters to remember about your goals for your time in office?</p>
				<ul class=""key-messages"">
					<li>Support the successful polices of President Trump. Secure our border; a country without borders is a No Man's Land.</li>
					<li>Protect our Bill of Rights. Our God-given rights to worship freely,  speak freely, keep and bear arms, along with our right to believe as our conscience dictates is under assault by big government and Leftists/Progressive ideology.</li>
					<li>Bring our country back to its founding principles  - recognize the sanctity of life, protect the unborn; allow families to teach children morality not government ordained Leftist/Progressive ideologies.</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
							<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What areas of public policy are you personally passionate about?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">If you believe, as I do, that religion and morality have been vilified by Leftist politicians, liberal media and that the federal courts have been undermining our constitution, I am your candidate.

If you believe, as I do, that the moral collapse of America and the rise of socialist anti-prosperity policy police are a threat to your rights, I am your candidate.

If you believe, as I do, that the curriculum in our public educational system has been replaced with anti-American rhetoric and liberal political views, I am your candidate.

If you believe, as I do, in the sanctity of life from conception to natural death, in parental rights, and that the family unit is the backbone of our great society, I am your candidate.

If you believe, as I do, that America's free market capitalist system has been integral to our worldwide generosity, inspiring freedom lovers everywhere to dream, and offering our blessings to those in need, I am your candidate.

There has been an ongoing campaign against the America we all know and love; as President Abraham Lincoln warned, \""The philosophy of the school room in one generation, becomes the philosophy of government in the next.\""    Apathy and atrophy are a disease to our nation; recognizing this is a critical step towards restoration and revival. The profit Daniel, who triumphed over the lions' den said, \"" [...] the people who know their God will display strength and take action. We Want Our Country Back.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Who do you look up to? Whose example would you like to follow, and why?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">QUEEN ESTER of the Persian king Ahasuerus (commonly identified as Xerxes I, reigned 486-465 BCE) became queen through an interesting turn of events. When faced with political expediency or potential fatal personal consequences, she exhibited the courage to do right by her people and God. Ester exhibited courage and faith.

KING DAVID (reigned c. 1010-970 BCE) Predecessor King Saul became jealous of David and tried to have him killed. While hiding in a cave, David has a chance to kill Saul who is unaware of David's presence but rather than Killing Saul, David merely cuts off a corner of Saul's robe, and when Saul exited the cave David shows the cut off piece of robe, evidencing that he could have killed him but holds no malice towards Saul. Similarly, David is able to infiltrate Saul's camp and remove Saul's spear and a jug of water from his side while he and his guards lie asleep. The two are thus reconciled and Saul recognises David as his successor. 

As King, David commits adultery with Bathsheba, leading him to arrange the death of her husband Uriah after a cover-up scheme fails. David and Bathsheba eventually marry and their son, Solomon, becomes one of the wisest men who ever lived. David, an imperfect man who had compassion and wanted to do right was a great king - despite his human failings and human shortcomings.

PRESIDENT REAGAN sought to restore prayer in schools and later a moment of silence. Reagan became the first president to propose a constitutional amendment on school prayer and called for Congress to end \""the expulsion of God from America's classrooms.\""

PRESIDENT TRUMP whose campaign was courageous if not somewhat rogue. Despite his failings and human shortcomings, an imperfect man like all men, he loves this country, has compassion and wants to do right for America as President.

				<p class=""survey-question"">What is the first historical event that happened in your lifetime that you remember? How old were you at the time?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">The assignation of President John F. Kennedy; I was five years old.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What was your very first job? How long did you have it?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Apprentice truck and equipment mechanic. It was a summer job when I was a teenager.
That summer I also worked as a lifeguard.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What qualities does the U.S. House of Representatives possess that makes it unique as an institution?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">According to Ray Smock, as published by The Dirksen Congressional Center, \""The House as Embodiment of Representative Democracy.\""

House of Representatives, or The People's House as it is sometimes called is embodiment of the Founders' idea of representative democracy.  The Framers of the Constitution made the House of representatives the first branch of government and fashioned its composition and function such that it would be most closely related to the will of the people. It was called \""The First Branch of the legislature because the sentiments, needs and desires of the people would be represented there, in The House of representatives.

George Mason of Virginia (delegate to the U.S. Constitutional Convention of 1787) said, \""The House would know and sympathize with every part of the community.\""  He viewed the House of Representatives as representing \""the rights of every class of people.\""</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Do you believe that it's beneficial for representatives to have previous experience in government or politics?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Yes, provided that the experience of the representative in question demonstrated representing the will of the people and not special interests to whom he or she was beholden to. So prevalent unfortunately is it that men and women get elected to some office at some level of government and almost immediately forget the people who elected them and act as though they were 'owned' by the special interests that either employ them, fund their campaigns - or both.

It is however beneficial for the voting public to see and observe the conduct of elected officials so as to judge their actions and loyalties. If a man or woman elected to some office uses that office to display character, integrity and courage - it will benefit the voters in deciding whether or not to elect that man or woman to higher office such as the house of representatives.

If, however, that man or woman uses his or her time in office to ignore their oath and, almost immediately it seems sometimes, just use that office for their own self-promotion and obedience to special interests then, though unfortunate, is is beneficial for voters to be mindful of the character traits that experience of that man or woman's time in office revealed,</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What do you perceive to be the United States’ greatest challenges as a nation over the next decade?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Restoring America - getting back to the foundational formula of our Founders.  We have strayed from America's ways that protected and provided success for us. 
So many of our challenges are inextricably intertwined with this, but we have strayed so far that it will be a great challenge. This is not a new thought in fact, historically the following quotes were (and are) telling.

\""Our constitution was made only for a moral and religious people. It is wholly inadequate to the government of any other.\"" President John Adams

\""The philosophy of the school room in one generation, becomes the philosophy of government in the next.\"" President Abraham Lincoln

\""If we don't have a proper fundamental moral background, we will finally end up with a totalitarian government, which does not believe in rights for anybody except the state.\"" President Harry Truman

\""The rights of man come not from the state but from the hand of God.\"" President John Kennedy

Our rights, flowing through The Constitution and The Bill of Rights have been under attack and have been so eroded over time that our rights and liberties today are all but unrecognizable to what the Founders intended. We need to get back on track and Make America America Again - We Want Our Country Back. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">If you are not a current representative, are there certain committees that you would want to be a part of?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Committees: Homeland Security, Judiciary,  Small Business, Transportation &amp; Infrastructure, Veteran's Affairs.

Non-Standing Committees/Sub-Committees: Intelligence / Counterterrorism, Counterintelligence and Counterproliferation, Defense Intelligence and Warfighter Support, Intelligence Modernization and Readiness</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Do you believe that two years is the right term length for representatives?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Two years results in Representatives always campaigning and always fundraising.  
A slightly longer term, perhaps three or four years is at least worthy of consideration and study.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What are your thoughts on term limits?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">The concept of terms limits makes sense and deserves serious consideration.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">If you are not currently a member of your party’s leadership in the U.S. House of Representatives, would you be interested in joining the leadership? If so, in what role?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I would be interested in serving in leadership should my colleagues are of that mind; the role would be determined as to where my skill-set and traits best fit. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Is there a particular representative, past or present, whom you want to model yourself after?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">There are qualities I like in certain Representatives and, once in office and having an opportunity to work with (and perhaps against) certain Members, I could be better equipped to provide an answer.

That being said, I would try to learn from the more seasoned members who love God and Country, who are also honest and courageous. Sometimes these traits seem lacking in government. 

So many officials - and especially candidates, are too fearful of taking a position or stand on issues by always trying to be in the middle - or on \""all three sides of every issue\""  that these men and women, trying to be everything for everyone,  are nothing to noone. </p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">Who are you? Tell us about yourself in 300 words or less.</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Jeff Smith - The Bold Republican you need in congress!

I grew up on a cattle ranch north of Elgin, Oregon.  I went Oregon Institute of Technology in Klamath Falls, and since then I spent most of my adult life in the aerospace industry.  I have seen the hollowing out of the middle class in Oregon, and I want to bring back jobs.

Protect Social Security, lower Medical Care Costs, Pro-Life, Pro- Business, Pro- Agriculture, Pro - Logging,

Pro-Trump - President Trump has done an out standing job of getting the economy going, appointing great Supreme Court Justices, building the wall, and slashing regulations.

Pro- Life - Jeff Smith believes that life is a gift from God, and that humane life begins at conception. Because of that, Jeff Smith is opposed to legalized abortion. He is also opposed to funding for Planned Parenthood.</p>

				</ul>
			</div>
							<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What areas of public policy are you personally passionate about?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I have seen our communities go from utilizing the federally owned natural resources in most of the counties in southern and eastern Oregon, to having the local hospital being the biggest employers in the county.  We need to change the Endangered Species Act to get back to having jobs in Oregon, giving our kids a chance to live here and take back our way of life.  A way of life that the Federal Government has been taking away from us for decades. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">

			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What do you perceive to be the United States’ greatest challenges as a nation over the next decade?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">The biggest challenge to the USA is the overspending by the Federal Government.  We are 22 Trillion dollars in debt and that trend is unsustainable.  At some point the USA is going to go over the cliff.  We have to control the spending or the country will self-destruct.

Jeff Smith wants to have a constitutional amendment to balance the budget.</p>

						    <div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Please list below 3 key messages of your campaign. What are the main points you want voters to remember about your goals for your time in office?</p>
				<ul class=""key-messages"">
					<li>Liberty is a basic pillar of Americanism.</li>
					<li>Life is a gift from God, not any government.  No government has the right to take that gift or delegate that right to someone else </li>
					<li>Every citizen has Equal rights, and Equal responsibilities.  With Rights come Responsibilities; and with Responsibilities come Rights.</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
							<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What areas of public policy are you personally passionate about?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">1.  Liberty; 2.  Life; 3.  Equal Rights and Equal Responsibilities; 4.  We are a Constitutional Republic; 5.  Cutting Spending; 6.  Reforming taxes even more; 7.  Fixing the Farm Bill; and 8.  Securing the border.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Who do you look up to? Whose example would you like to follow, and why?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Ronald Reagan.  He is the first and only President of my life that understood, totally believed in, and fought for the four pillars of Americanism:  Liberty, Life, Equal rights and Equal responsibility; and our Constitutional Republic.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What characteristics or principles are most important for an elected official?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Honesty, Altruism, and an understand that you are there to serve your constituents, and the United States; not yourself or you party.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What qualities do you possess that you believe would make you a successful officeholder?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I have a firm understand of Natural Law; the U.S. Constitution; and Congressional authority and limitations.  I also know that every action that does not have to be done immediately should be considered to determine how much it will impinge on the pillars of Americanism, and what the collateral consequences will be.  Second, a dollar should not be thrown at a 50 cent problem,</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What is your favorite book? Why?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Once an Eagle.  It shows the human hurtles a true servant must overcome.  These people (the human hurtles) exist every where in the Military as well as in civilian life.  If you love your country,and love your fellow human beings, you must overcome these road blocks.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Do you believe that it's beneficial for representatives to have previous experience in government or politics?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I do.  This experience gives candidates knowledge of problems and how to fix them.  It is not necessary, but it creates a legislator ready to roll on day one.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What do you perceive to be the United States’ greatest challenges as a nation over the next decade?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">The first thing we need to do is cut the congressional budget.  Congress spends over half a billion dollars on itself every year.  We need to start our cuts here.  Second, our taxes are still unfair and the average person pays too much.  We need to reform our tax code even more.  Third, I am not against duties.  We should put a 10% duty on everything that comes into the U.S., and if another country puts a higher duty on American products, we should match that duty.  Forth, our Military needs to be completely rebuilt, and we need to stop the September spending frenzy.  Fifth, our immigration system needs to be reformed, but first, we need to secure the border.  Sixth, our Federal highways need to be completely reworked.  Seventh, minor changes need to be made to the Uniform Code of Military Justice.  Eighth, title 32 needs to be reformed.  Ninth, our U.S. farm policy needs to be completely redone with a view towards freeing farmers from Federal control.  Tenth, our education system needs to be completely rebuilt, leaving most decision to the county level.</p>

One single mother single mother in a low paying job enrolled her three children ages 7 through 12 in our program.  The public school bus would drop the students off at the learning center each day.  She would ride the bus from work each day to pick them up and then take them on the 30 minute ride home.

There was a pending bus strike.  When asked how she would get to work in case the strike came to fruition, how would she get to work..She indicated she would get her bike fixed to make the 25-mile round trip to work each day.

Later, she came to us to let us know she could barely read or write and was embarrassed to let her children to know.  When offered she readily agreed to sign up for the program and have individual teaching in a separate room.

I loved her commitment to family, work ethic, attitude, as well as the value placed on education...especially the part on riding her bike to work. Seeing those values in her smiling children made it even more special.</p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">Please list below 3 key messages of your campaign. What are the main points you want voters to remember about your goals for your time in office?</p>
				<ul class=""key-messages"">
					<li>I have actual plans written out on hansenforcongress.com explaining what I want to do and how I want to do them on key issues. No other candidate does.</li>
					<li>My Faith, commitment, business experience and Constitutional studies make me the most qualified person for the job. </li>

				<p class=""survey-question"">What areas of public policy are you personally passionate about?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">     Health care. We have been without health insurance for 23 years and with the experience gained studying what is broken with the system and in negotiating medical bills, like Jeanett's heart surgery, I have developed a health care plan to solve this problem.
     Illegal immigration. I want the wall built; the end to chain migration and visa lottery; and proper funding and personal to make the system more efficient. I have also developed a \""red card\"" plan to address the issue of current illegal immigrants here in America and a solution to the DACA issue.
     Education. End the cookie cutter \""everyone needs to go to college\"" system and institute programs to identify what areas youth excel and encouraging them through our educational system to follow those passions. \""There is nothing that so lifts the human spirit as success through one's own efforts\"" (my campaign slogan) and this is accomplished through proper education which should not be limited by your zip code. Children in failing schools should have alternatives like charter schools.
     Taxes. Simplify further
     Budget. Nothing less that a freeze; then reduce 1% a year.
     Regulations. Continue to reassess/eliminate burdensome ones.
     Agriculture. Revitalize. Younger farmers back on the land.
     Defend Life. Heartbeat
     Second Amendment. No new regulations. Reciprocity.
     Military. Peace through strength.

				<p class=""survey-response"">Moon Landing. 20 July 1969. Sitting in front of our black and white TV at 220 47th Street.  I was seven years old. Got me started on the road of studying about America and its exceptionalism. Bought my first book, 'The life anb times of George Washington' form the Scholastic Book Club at William Rall School in Lidenhurst, Long Island, New York that Fall.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What was your very first job? How long did you have it?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Wendy's Hamburgers. Summer of Freshman year in High School. Did a little bit of everything and then promoted to \""top job\"", hamburger cook.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What is your favorite book? Why?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Two Treatises on Government by John Locke
Excellent insight on a wide variety of the proper roles of a government that serves the people and explantions why.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">If you could be any fictional character, who would you want to be?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Woodrow F. Call</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What was the last song that got stuck in your head?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">It's my day to be brilliant' by Shinedown </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What is something that has been a struggle in your life?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Loss of a child. 
Loss of my Father at 52 because of the arrogance of others.
Otherwise stuggles are good. It is how we learn and build character if we look at them the right way, as lessons not punishments.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What qualities does the U.S. House of Representatives possess that makes it unique as an institution?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">The power of the purse and they need to use it in a more prudent and fiscally responsible way to eliminate waste, confine the government within its Constitutional authority, and eliminate the massive debt incurred from years uncontrolled spending (or at least get the debt down to a manageable size).</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Do you believe that it's beneficial for representatives to have previous experience in government or politics?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">No. As any business owner knows, our success relies on us being able to convince our customers that we have the right solutions, products or services and we have to provide them at a price the consumer wishes to pay. To do this we have to know how to negotiate and then deliver on what we promise. If we do a bad job at any of this, we do not get paid, we cannot pay our bills, our business fails and our family suffers. Those in government and politics routinely promise us the world on a silver platter and deliver a bag of dog crap. Then they still get paid, they pay their bills, their families do well and all the rest of us are the ones that suffer. What the government needs is more business owners and average Americans that know how America actually works and less politicians who have no clue how the real world outside the Washington beltway operates.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What do you perceive to be the United States’ greatest challenges as a nation over the next decade?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">To halt the spread of socialist ideology, defend the Constitution and re-educate the citizenry of America on the Ideals and Principles upon which our Nation was founded and made Her exceptional. Limited government, fiscal responsibility, personal responsibility, free market economics, Justice, Liberty and equal opportunity
Eliminate or at least substantially reduce the National Debt.
Maintain a strong military that continues to be more technologically advanced then our enemies so as to maintain our freedom.
To expose those that use emotional arguments to generate fear in order to create division in their attempt to maintain power. Reunite America.
</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">If you are not a current representative, are there certain committees that you would want to be a part of?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I think I have a wide enough variety of plans that I may provide solutions wherever I may be put. Healthcare, tax reform, immigration reform and reinvigorating our farming community are my main areas of concern, so whatever committee my ideas may fall under. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Do you believe that two years is the right term length for representatives?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Yes.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What are your thoughts on term limits?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I have already signed the pledge to push for a Constitutional Amendment for term limits. My personal preference would be for eight years in the House and 12 in the Senate.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">If you are not currently a member of your party’s leadership in the U.S. House of Representatives, would you be interested in joining the leadership? If so, in what role?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">My main goal is to become a member of the House Freedom Caucus and help promote it so as to garner enough votes to start influencing House business.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Is there a particular representative, past or present, whom you want to model yourself after?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">No, I want to be me and set a model others can look up to but I do admire Trey Gowdy for his intelligence, articulate speech and no BS approach.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Both sitting representatives and candidates for office hear many personal stories from the residents of their district. Is there a story that you’ve heard that you found particularly touching, memorable, or impactful?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I have heard many personal stories about disastrous health care situations especially when I relate mine own and am angered at the fact that medical providers took advantage of these people because they did not have the fortitude to stand up to them like I did. It is what really drives me to get this problem taken care of because I do not think it is as complicated at some make it seem. I have plans. The President has already instituted some of them and I want to institute the rest to get this job done. </p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">What would be your top three priorities, if elected?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">The issues we face as a society are interconnected and therefor, require interconnected solutions. Within the 7th district &amp; beyond, hard working community members are struggling to keep a roof over their heads, food on their tables, &amp; their loved ones safe from violence. In order to directly address these issues, our top priorities are to ensure that everyone has a fundamental right to housing, everyone has a fundamental right to medical care, &amp; that everyone has a fundamental right to an education, as well as employment that pays a livable wage.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What areas of public policy are you personally passionate about?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">As issues are interconnected, I am passionate about all policies &amp; look to improve in areas of knowledge, as well as ability to be an ally in verb form on a daily basis. In saying that, the areas of public policy that I am most passionate about, that I believe will lead to the type of systemic change that will empower the people are, our environmental policy, education policy, criminal justice policy, defense policy, civil rights, &amp; drug policy.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Who do you look up to? Whose example would you like to follow, and why?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I look up to my mother and father. My parents are selfless individuals who have dedicated their lives to providing, as well as creating opportunity for myself and others. They purposefully exposed me to all aspects of life so that I could experience and learn firsthand how wealth disparities and demographics help to determine an individual’s possibilities. 

My parents went without food, so that I would not go hungry. They went without material things, so that I could obtain a quality education. My mother and father worked countless hours, so that I would not go without a roof over my head. Their level of sacrifice has shaped who I am as a person and I truly believe that service to others is the rent we pay for room here on this Earth.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Is there a book, essay, film, or something else you would recommend to someone who wants to understand your political philosophy?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">If I could pick one publication that I believe best encompasses this movement &amp; my philosophy, it would be The War On Neighborhoods, Policing, Prison, &amp; Punishment in a Divided City by: Ryan Lugalia-Hollon &amp; Daniel Cooper. 

The opening of the text provides a quotes from Charles Mills, The Racial Contract, ""Without the will required to see that which is obscured, we will continue to produce &amp; reproduce human beings &amp; social relationships rooted in inequality &amp; captivity.""

I believe that Anthony Clark 2020 campaign is about speaking 'truth to power,' while educating &amp; empowering community members to not only no longer accept status quo, but to end it &amp; realize  a society of equality, free from captivity.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What characteristics or principles are most important for an elected official?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I believe good elected officials are genuine, honest, compassionate, aware of their strengths &amp; weaknesses, individuals who can follow, strong communicators, leaders with clear visions, strong listeners, individuals with empathy, &amp; individuals who value diversity.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What qualities do you possess that you believe would make you a successful officeholder?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I believe that I am a hard working, honest, genuine, &amp; compassionate person who recognizes &amp; celebrates the importance of diversity. I have dedicated my life to working within intersectional movements as an ally in verb form, as well as directly oppressed in efforts to realize systemic change. 

I am focused on the empowerment of others, not myself.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What do you believe are the core responsibilities for someone elected to this office?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">The founders wanted the House to be the legislative chamber closest to the people. In my opinion, it is impossible to be closest to the people, if as an elected official my core responsibilities are not based on listening to, working with, &amp; fighting alongside the people for their empowerment. There should be no other influence beyond the will of the people I represent.

No policy should be created, supported, or voted on without efforts to educate, learn from, &amp; work with the people to ensure said policy is in the best interest of the people.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What legacy would you like to leave?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I would love to leave a legacy of systemic change. As a collective, those who believe in human rights, including myself have failed to change individual aspects of our overall system, which I believe is built on a foundation of White Supremacy. I want to leave a legacy that clearly communicates I stood in solidarity &amp; fought with those who accomplished an entire system change in which all people have access to life, liberty, justice, happiness, &amp; opportunity.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What is the first historical event that happened in your lifetime that you remember? How old were you at the time?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">The first historical event I can vividly remember is the violent beating of Rodney King by Los Angeles Police Department officers in 1991. I was 9 years old glued to the television screen with my parents as reports of the incident poured in. That was the first time I truly ever feared the police &amp; from that moment, felt that I nor anyone else should have those feelings.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What was your very first job? How long did you have it?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">My parents believed in instilling strong values in me. I obtained my hard work ethic from both my mother &amp; father. My first two jobs were at the age of 14. My mother signed a work permit for me &amp; I worked part-time at a local pet store, as well as senior citizen building cleaning &amp; organizing. I maintained both those jobs until the age of 16, when I was hired at a local grocery store.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What was the last song that got stuck in your head?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I recently watched The Two Killings of Sam Cooke on Netflix. Sam was a true force to be reckoned with &amp; his song, A Change is Gonna Come, is stuck in my head on a daily basis. For me, the song not only serves as a 'battle cry,' of empowerment, but also as a testament of what true courage looks like. Sam was a crossover success &amp; releasing such a song put his success in jeopardy. However, Sam knew that in order for true change to occur, we have to be willing to risk &amp; sacrifice our own personal gain for the good of the collective. These are thoughts I continue to live by.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">If you are not a current representative, are there certain committees that you would want to be a part of?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">When I become the next representative of the 7th District, or I should say when 'we,' become the next representatives of the 7th District, as this campaign truly represents the community, the committees (most reps serve on 1 or 2) I as a representation of the people would most like to serve on are: Education &amp; Labor, Natural Resources, Veterans' Affairs, Ways &amp; Means, &amp; Oversight &amp; Reform.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What are your thoughts on term limits?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I 100% support term limits, as term limits strengthen Democracy by directly addressing the influence of incumbent politicians &amp; special interest groups that continue to ignore the will of the people. Term limits would counterbalancing incumbent advantages, ensure congressional turnover, secure independent congressional judgment, and reduce election-related incentives for wasteful government spending. 

One of the major issues within the 7th Congressional District &amp; beyond is the inability of entrenched incumbents to welcome new &amp; fresh ideas as the wills of communities change.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What process do you favor for redistricting?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I believe that redistricting is a mechanism utilized to manipulate our elections by allowing incumbent politicians to help partisan allies, hurt political enemies and choose their voters before the voters choose them. The current process is used as a means to further political goals by drawing boundaries to protect incumbents and reduce competition, rather than to ensure equal voting power and fair representation.

There are multiple reform approaches to redistricting &amp; to garner my support, the approach would have to be one that maximizes citizen participation &amp; independence from legislative pressure.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">If you are not currently a member of your party’s leadership in the U.S. House of Representatives, would you be interested in joining the leadership? If so, in what role?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I believe that leaders come in many forms, with many styles and diverse qualities. Recognizing the strengths I bring to the table in building strong coalitions as a teacher, activist, &amp; community organizer, I would look to serve as a leader in impact Democratic leadership in whatever capacity would allow me to help push for systemic change.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Is there a particular representative, past or present, whom you want to model yourself after?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">The reason I originally chose to accept the community nomination to run for office, is because in my lifetime, I have yet to meet or know of a representative, that I believed truly represented the people &amp; placed the needs of the people above party affiliations. 

As a good friend of mine who happens to be an awesome woman leader says, ""I have declared my allegiance to the issues, not to parties."" I am an individual focused on changing issues on a systemic level &amp; up until 2018, I didn't know of any representatives that truly inspired, as well as motivated me.

Now, powerful &amp; inspiring Representatives like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ayanna Pressley, &amp; Ilah Omar give me hope for the future, as well as motivate me to continue to rock the boat in a push for change in my district.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Both sitting representatives and candidates for office hear many personal stories from the residents of their district. Is there a story that you’ve heard that you found particularly touching, memorable, or impactful?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I have been a teacher for 9 years &amp; in those 9 years, I have lost numerous students to gun violence. 

In 2016, a day before his 17th birthday, Elijah Sims, a student I had grown close to was murdered due to senseless gun violence. Elijah was a young man who could brighten everyone's day with his smile &amp; who loved his family. Elijah worked a part-time job, had recently fallen in love with a classmate, &amp; was looking forward to eventually graduating high school. 

Simply by making the choice to go visit family &amp; friends in the Austin community, Elijah was an innocent bystander caught in senseless gun violence. 

Following Elijah's death, my organization held a vigil to honor his legacy. There I met Elijah's mother &amp; family. From that moment, Elijah's mother &amp; I became family &amp; we have sense dedicated ourselves to bringing his murderers to justice, while also proactively fighting to end gun violence in our society. 

The stories Elijah's mother shares with me about him are always my favorite as each helps to keep his memory alive, while also providing the renewed energy required to maintain our fight.</p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">Who are you? Tell us about yourself in 300 words or less.</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I am an antiwar/progressive activist, former HS math teacher, husband &amp; father.  I've been active in electoral politics my whole adult life.  I am a DSA member and my political views are to the left of the establishment Democratic Party.  I believe good government is possible, but only when people are inspired to be involved. I oppose imperialism both at home and abroad. I oppose the corporate takeover of our government.  I believe in union jobs and a living wage.  I believe in people over profits. I believe that the timeline for reversing the climate emergency is shorter than people realize and that we must act immediately.  I believe that education and healthcare are human rights.  I believe that when we invest in people everyone benefits.  I oppose the militarization of police.  I oppose the war on drugs and believe that all drugs should be decriminalized and addictions should be treated as health concerns, not criminal issues.  I oppose policies of militarism and endless war.  

I am running my campaign with grassroots people power.  I have pledged to take no corporate PAC money, now or ever.  I support Bernie Sanders and the progressive movement.  Together, we will win.</p>
			</div>
						    <div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Please list below 3 key messages of your campaign. What are the main points you want voters to remember about your goals for your time in office?</p>
				<ul class=""key-messages"">
					<li>Medicare For All.  The National Improved Medicare For All bill is the most cost effective and comprehensive way to deliver healthcare to all residents of the US as a HUMAN RIGHT.</li>
					<li>Climate Change is real, it is caused by human activity, and it is essential that we change our energy infrastructure NOW to eliminate fossil fuel emissions.  Solving this issue ten years from now will be too late.</li>
					<li>Campaign Finance Reform and getting money out of politics is essential if we are to have a government that works for all people.</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
							<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What areas of public policy are you personally passionate about?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">- Healthcare (Medicare For All); people need to know that the M4A bills are vast improvements over the current Medicare system.  No premiums, no copays, free at the point of service.  Dental, Vision, Hearing care are covered.  Long term care is covered.  It is universal and comprehensive.
- Climate Change; climate change is the greatest threat to humanity.  The timeline for solving and implementing solutions is extremely short, and once we pass the tipping point, there is no going back.  We are close, and we must act now to change our energy systems to sustainable and renewable energies.
- Reducing military budget and military presence.  The military is the world's biggest polluter, and our imperialist policies have created more enemies than they have defeated.  We need to stop interfering in other nation's politics on behalf of corporate resource extraction.
- Affordable housing is a human right.  I support federal investments in affordable housing in order to eliminate homelessness.
- College and post-secondary trade schools and training should be tuition and fee free.  This is an investment in our people should be universal and will benefit everyone.
- I believe that unions benefit all workers, and I support many avenues to increase union membership and strengthen the power of unions.  I oppose Right to Work legislation.
- I oppose the militarization of police and support better screening and training for police so that there is better community representation.
</p>

					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Who do you look up to? Whose example would you like to follow, and why?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Bernie Sanders.  Nina Turner.  Cornel West.  AOC.  Rashida Tlaib.  Ilhan Omar. Krystal Ball.  Cesar Chavez.  Evo Morales.  There are a lot of people I look up to and admire.  The common thread is that they all speak up for the masses and against the oligarchy that seeks to suppress the masses.  Often they do it at great personal and professional risk.  I believe without people who are willing to take risks in the defense of the general public, we all become subjects to concentrated power and wealth.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Is there a book, essay, film, or something else you would recommend to someone who wants to understand your political philosophy?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Anything by Michael Moore.  He is an American hero.

Also, if you listen to the punk band Bad Religion, their lyrics pretty much sum up my political philosophy.

Watch the 2006 documentary The Corporation.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What characteristics or principles are most important for an elected official?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Honesty and integrity.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What qualities do you possess that you believe would make you a successful officeholder?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Honesty and Integrity.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What do you believe are the core responsibilities for someone elected to this office?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Serve the best interests of the public, NOT corporations.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What legacy would you like to leave?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">That I was part of releasing this country from the stranglehold of corporate corruption and subservience.  That I helped get Medicare For All passed.  That I helped save the country and planet for the climate crisis.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What is the first historical event that happened in your lifetime that you remember? How old were you at the time?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I remember when John Lennon was killed.  I was 9. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What was your very first job? How long did you have it?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I worked for Godfather's Pizza during the summer between my senior year in high school and my freshman year in college.  </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What is your favorite book? Why?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Narcissus and Goldmund by Hermann Hesse.  I read it in high school and it was a coming of age story that always stayed with me.

And The Little Prince.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">If you could be any fictional character, who would you want to be?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I don't know that I would want to BE this person, but this is a character that I feel is my muse in many ways - RP MacMurphy from One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.  Jack Nicholson's best role about someone continually fighting systemic idiocy and oppression.  Not the most morally straight character, understood, but the attitude of Mac is somewhat ingrained in my own personality, as people who know me would attest.</p>

					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What was the last song that got stuck in your head?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">\""Suffer\"" by Bad Religion.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What is something that has been a struggle in your life?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Divorce and co-parenting.  </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What qualities does the U.S. House of Representatives possess that makes it unique as an institution?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I don't believe that the US House of Representatives is \""special\"" or unique.  It has legislative powers as do other worldwide legislative bodies.  I believe in the balance of powers between the 3 branches.  But the US House is an institution that is currently for sale to the highest bidder, Democrats and Republicans alike.  This is why I am running my campaign with No Corporate PAC money.  Having an unbought and unbossed Congress is the only way to effectively serve the country.  We have a perpetual state of purchased perversion in Congress and its why the US public does not trust Congress and rates is so abysmally.  I believe we can do much better, and seek to lead by example. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Do you believe that it's beneficial for representatives to have previous experience in government or politics?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Not necessarily, but I believe it's important for people to have a basic understanding of the powers of government and what can and can't be done.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What do you perceive to be the United States’ greatest challenges as a nation over the next decade?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Climate Change.  The healthcare issue is of great national importance, and is at the top of my list of policy objectives, but I believe we the bigger and more important fight will be to restructure our energy systems to reverse rising temperatures.  I'm not optimistic that we can do it, but we must try.  Humanity has no future if we don't change the way we produce and consume energy.  Unfortunately the forces allied against that change are only interested in short term profits and give no thought to future generations.  </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">If you are not a current representative, are there certain committees that you would want to be a part of?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I would gladly serve on any committee, but my passions would be Education/Labor,  Energy and Commerce,  Oversight and Reform, and Ways and Means.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">If you are a current representative, why did you join your current committees?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">N/A</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Do you believe that two years is the right term length for representatives?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">No.  I believe it should be a 4 year term.  Current representatives are stuck in a cycle of continual campaigning that I do not believe is effective.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What are your thoughts on term limits?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I have mixed feelings.   On the whole I think its a good idea.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">If you are not currently a member of your party’s leadership in the U.S. House of Representatives, would you be interested in joining the leadership? If so, in what role?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Let me be clear: I am not supported by party leadership.  Current party leadership and the way the DNC and DCCC/DSCC operate is all about big money and nothing to do with effectively serving the public.  I do not believe everyone with a D behind their name is a good or effective representative.   I would seek substantial reforms in how the party operates.  I am all about effective policy to serve the public.  I believe that if we are honest with the public about policy, we will win their support.  I do not believe in misdirection and obfuscation.  I do not believe that current party leader is either honest or effective.

My whole campaign is about demanding better.  That's why I am challenging a sitting Democrat from the left.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Is there a particular representative, past or present, whom you want to model yourself after?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Bernie Sanders.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Both sitting representatives and candidates for office hear many personal stories from the residents of their district. Is there a story that you’ve heard that you found particularly touching, memorable, or impactful?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Everyone I know and everyone I talk to has a story - either their own story or someone close to them - about how the current healthcare system in this country has underserved them.  The current healthcare system literally kills people for profit.  It killed my mother, and its on its way to killing my sister.

I believe that health insurance companies should quite simply be abolished.  They are parasitic.  They serve no purpose other than to generate profits from suffering.  I will seek this, on behalf of all of the people they have denied care to.</p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">What would be your top three priorities, if elected?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">1.     Economic development on the Mississippi Gulf Coast.  This includes creating opportunities and initiatives for new businesses and making sure the BP settlement funds are spent on projects that provide an economic return for the District and the Coast.
2. Education.  Mississippi's public schools have come a long way but there is work to be done. A recent report by our State Auditor shows administrative and non-instructional spending in our public schools has increased exponentially. If teacher pay raises, student resources, and other educational improvements can be made by re-directing administrative funding, that is where we need to start.
3. Maintain small government with a balanced budget.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What areas of public policy are you personally passionate about?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I am passionate about the Mississippi Sound.  As a former fishing guide and avid recreational fisherman, I have always enjoyed fishing and boating in the Mississippi Sound and our barrier islands, and always admired the commercial fishermen who make a living working in the Sound.  I also believe in the State's blue economy that is centered around the Sound.  I want to see projects and initiatives to help the Sound come back from this year's freshwater intrusion even stronger than before.</p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">What do you believe are the core responsibilities for someone elected to this office?</p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">What would be your top three priorities, if elected?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Education: John believes that education SHOULD be the Civil Rights fight of the 21st Century. Access to a superior education should not be limited to those of economic privilege, and he is a strong supporter of school choice. Any and all avenues must remain open so that all have a pathway to success. 
John also believes that the more local education is, the more efficiently it operates. The Federal Government’s role in education should be limited, at best, and that parents and local communities are best equipped to deal with the educational challenges of their children. 

Economy: John is a strong proponent of the free market and believes that the Government that governs least, governs best. Deregulation, simplification of the tax code, and pro-growth policies need to be in place to create opportunities for ALL Americans. He also believes that the National Debt needs to be reduced and is in favor of a balanced budget amendment, so that out of control government spending does not bankrupt the country’s future generations. 

Health Care: John believes that Government interference in health care, at both the Federal and State levels, has driven up costs, has severely limited an individual’s ability to obtain the appropriate insurance policy, and has taken medical decisions out of the hands of patients and physicians and put them in the hands of uniformed bureaucrats. He is a proponent of low cost, non mandated, insurance, particularly for young people just entering the work force, in tax free health savings accounts, and in allowing companies to supply health</p>

					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What areas of public policy are you personally passionate about?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">infrastructure is a major concern we have in our district.

We have huge problems in the Bronx, and Queens with traffic to the point where I think some of the roads are dangerous, not because they’re designed improperly, but just because they’re too crowded. We need to somehow alleviate some of the traffic, as I’ve mentioned, several ideas before.

The fact that, and a lot of people don’t even realize this, there is not a truck stop for truckers to use. Of course, they’re a key part of our economy. There’s only a certain amount of hours that these truckers can drive in a day. And they get stuck in massive traffic jams around the city. And then they have the time out, basically pack it up where they are. And that leaves trucks parked where they shouldn’t be.
And that’s something that the federal government really needs to take a look at with this infrastructure project that’s supposed to be coming up. This major infrastructure bill is supposed to pass.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What characteristics or principles are most important for an elected official?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I believe that a representative needs to be much more present, and available in the district.  I understand if I am elected, I would have to spend a lot of time in Washington.  But, you know, it’s not like this district is in Oregon. You can get back and forth pretty quickly from New York to Washington by driving or as Vice President Biden did – use the AMTRAK.  Whatever you have to do to get to the people you represent. 

There is just a serious lack of presence from our Congressional leaders.  It’s as if they have forgotten who they are representing.  I think not being present in the district, leads to a complete disconnect of what’s going on here, and there are some pressing issues that are not addressed by anyone.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What qualities do you possess that you believe would make you a successful officeholder?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I am a leader - I believe in leading by example. As a Civics and History teacher, I believe it is our duty to be involved in how our country is run.</p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">Both sitting representatives and candidates for office hear many personal stories from the residents of their district. Is there a story that you’ve heard that you found particularly touching, memorable, or impactful?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">William De Toma comes to mind.  BIlly wrote an impactful story about how I helped him in his life. That as a teacher I reached out to him, and helped him graduate.   It is amazing how someone from almost 15 years ago can believe I could have made such an impact on their lives.</p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">Who are you? Tell us about yourself in 300 words or less.</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Robert Perry is running for United States Congress to represent all the people in Kentucky's 2nd Congressional District. Having spent 25 years as a successful software engineer, Robert has proven that he can think for himself, and just as importantly, he is not a professional politician. Robert's disdain for our ""two-party"" system and its encouragement of fear and envy has driven him to action.
 
Introduced to the word ""libertarian"" during a 2000 debate that included Libertarian presidential candidate Harry Browne, Robert feels as though he has been a libertarian all his life. This passion is reflected in his many pursuits, whether it be his management style or the technical detail of his software designs. To Robert, libertarianism is an elegant solution that organizes society in a way that maximizes both harmony and prosperity.
 
Robert has been an outspoken and active participant in the libertarian movement. He studied the works of brilliant observers who saw how peaceful exchanges of values lead to higher social order and greater prosperity for all. He has supported Libertarian candidates, the Libertarian National Committee, and the Libertarian Party of Kentucky. He played a role in gaining ballot access for Libertarians in three states.
 
In 2020, he is going further. Robert is taking time away from his career to offer Kentuckians a Representative in the federal government that will push for a peaceful path to prosperity.</p>

A faith-filled businessman, Jeff serves as Chairman of Coleman Worldwide Moving, one of Alabama's 30 largest companies and employs thousands of people across the country.  Jeff is also a graduate of the Air War College National Security Forum and was appointed to serve as the Civilian Aide to the Secretary of the Army for Alabama in June 2017. Like President Trump, Jeff is a conservative outsider and a businessman who cares more about doing what's right for Alabama families and the country than winning an election. In addition to backing pro-business policies and our military, Jeff supports common-sesnse immigration reform that includes a strong, secure border and policies that benefit Alabama's agriculture industry like free and fair trade.</p><p></p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">Who do you look up to? Whose example would you like to follow, and why?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I look up to my father and mother. They raised 4 kids, &amp; lived pay check to pay check. At times they struggled to make ends meet. Yet they gave my siblings and I a great family life, and I'm truly grateful for that. They taught us to appreciate what we have in the United States.
I try to emulate their example with my own children. I've got 3 little ones, and I try to be involved in every aspect of their lives. I try to raise them so that they love and appreciate America, and the freedoms we have here. Being a father is a wonderful privilege. </p>

					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What characteristics or principles are most important for an elected official?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Elected officials need to understand that elections are not about them. They're about the people they serve.

				<p class=""survey-question"">Who are you? Tell us about yourself in 300 words or less.</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Love is the first word to begin this campaign and is representative of how I will lead in congress, with love. My understanding of justice as a function of love is inspired by the work of Dr. Martin Luther King and I believe this interpretation of justice is what we need, as a nation, at this time. I also believe that first establishing this foundation of love and justice, before addressing the ""issues"", is unique in a political campaign and warrants deep consideration by the people of the 11th district in Ohio and throughout the country. 

My personal and professional experience has prepared me to represent Ohioans in the 11th district with unprecedented care, concern and expertise. My background is in accounting, finance, taxation and public housing. As congressman, I will work toward better outcomes in education and environmental policy, but most of all I will pursue outcomes in equity: equal pay, equal access, and addressing the many and disproportionate challenges that result from poverty and bias. These challenges include, infant and maternal mortality, access to nutrition, and justice reform.

Join me!

 Wrap your arms and mind around this campaign and bring New Spirit to Congress!

Thank you and God bless.

				<p class=""survey-question"">What is the first historical event that happened in your lifetime that you remember? How old were you at the time?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I can remember the eerie morning of September 11, 2001 like it was yesterday. I was a student at Temple University in Philadelphia, heading to my part-time job on South Street. Now, if you are familiar with Philadelphia and South Street, you know that it is a busy place. Well, the morning of 9/11, I rode my bicycle into work and the streets were empty, I mean completely. When I arrived at my job, it was closed- I was still not aware of what was happening. I then rode to my best friend's nearby apartment. The front door was wide open and he and a few others were sitting on the couch transfixed by what was happening on TV. I was soon informed and soon witnessed the second plane crash into the World Trade Center. This horrific event impacted all of us deeply. Given our proximity and fondness for New York City, we visited Ground Zero (or as close as possible) several times that year. What was the most significant and most inspiring outcome from the event, for me, was how the people of New York came together, how the stereotypical \""New York state of mind\"" was no more. New York immediately became one of the friendliest cities I had known; not just friendly, but heartfelt. From all the pain and tragedy, the world witnessed the resilience and love that filled the eyes and hearts of New Yorkers and Americans throughout the country. This will forever be inspiring to me; I will never forget this.</p>

				<p class=""survey-response"">Yes.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What are your thoughts on term limits?</p>

Term limits will encourage a more ebullient and innovative Congressional body that is more responsive to social and cultural change.</p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">Who are you? Tell us about yourself in 300 words or less.</p>
				<p class=""survey-response""> I'm not a career politician.  I am a business owner and entrepreneur and real estate investor.   I'm happily married and live in Winterville, NC. and my husband and I share four adult children.  We have two beautiful farms in Pitt County where we embrace the farming and agricultural life, raising honey bees and a rare species of free-range pig from New Zealand.   I come from a very strong military family as my father was in the Air Force, my daughter is a United States Marine and my husband and his family served in the Army.  I graduated with honors from East Carolina University with a Bachelor's in Business and Technology.   I'm a real estate investor and have multiple residential, commercial and agricultural properties.  I have an extensive business background with a focus in accounting and finance, marketing and international trade. I've held the title of CFO of a material handling company and a construction firm.  I'm a woman faith and view myself as a strong Conservative Republican that truly loves  American and is proud to embraces all of its greatness.</p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">Please list below 3 key messages of your campaign. What are the main points you want voters to remember about your goals for your time in office?</p>
				<ul class=""key-messages"">
					<li>Pro-America &amp; Pro-Trump</li>
					<li>Pro 2nd Amendment</li>
					<li>Build the Wall and Defend our Borders</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
							<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What areas of public policy are you personally passionate about?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">LIFE
I believe that life begins with conception. As your Congresswoman, I will fight every day to protect and defend the sanctity of life, including the unborn. I believe that late and so-called \""fourth term\"" abortions must be prohibited without exception. As we continue to fight for every life, we also need to look at reforming adoption policies and costs so more orphaned children can live their dream of having a family of their own.

2nd  AMENDMENT 
As our founders declared, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed. I am a proud gun owner with a North Carolina concealed carry permit. I believe that the right to self-defense is a basic human right, and will work tirelessly to defend our 2nd Amendment rights.

ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION
We need to stop the Democrat lawlessness and secure our country. There are too many angel moms. I support President Trump's Border Wall and strong border security, and will work with Trump to finish the wall, end chain migration, and fix the crisis on the border.

OUR MILITARY
We have to do better supporting our military service members, on and off the battlefield. I will fight for the best care for our veterans. As a military wife and mother of a Marine, I've seen first-hand what's wrong and will work every day to fix it.

				<p class=""survey-question"">Who are you? Tell us about yourself in 300 words or less.</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">My name is David Kim, and I'm a committed, courageous and trusting leader. I am a 2nd generation Asian American who currently works as a music attorney in the film industry, while serving as a Board Member on the MacArthur Park Neighborhood Council. And my goal is to achieve financial freedom for every American as it doesn't make sense for us to have 2-3 jobs just to make ends meet. And that's why I'm running for Congress: to provide a Universal Basic Income of 1K/month, to provide free Universal Medicare, to provide free public college and higher education, to cancel student debt on a one-time basis and to ban politicians like our current Congressman (Jimmy Gomez) from accepting and pocketing corporate donations. Additionally, we need to fight Climate Change and implement BIG policies for change, in implementing a Green New Deal and infrastructure to save our planet, country and people, abolish ICE, establish a US Citizenship Track Program for Undocumented Workers, Mass Decarceration, Gun Control and more.</p>

				<p class=""survey-response"">Marianne Williamson's Politics of Love, Andrew Yang's The War On Normal People, Annie Lowry's Give People Money</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What characteristics or principles are most important for an elected official?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Integrity, Honesty, Vulnerability, Accountability, Trust, Passion, Diligence, Communication and Leadership are the most important for an elected official to have. </p>

				<p class=""survey-response"">My leadership, diligence, passion, vision, heart for the people, legal advocacy training and laser focus all contribute in making me the most qualified candidate to win this race and to effectively serve as a representative for the people, with no strings attached. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What do you believe are the core responsibilities for someone elected to this office?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">The core responsibilities for someone elected to this office is to: (1) vow not to accept any corporate donations or money because doing so taints one's ability to effectively think for and decide on issues in the interests of our people; (2) be deeply aware that every decision that is made is a moral decision, deeply affecting the lives of millions of Americans and shouldn't be taken lightly - even an abstention; (3) to always walk the walk, and not just talk the talk, and to be an effective, communicative leader who doesn't waver; and (4) to be deeply aware and realize that not one soul is less than another in any way</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What legacy would you like to leave?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I would like to leave a legacy where masses of positive, loving change agents who don't compromise the interests of our people, continue to rise up and take the initiative in protecting our communities and really living for the people, and not for corporate interests, power or short term maximization of profits. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What is the first historical event that happened in your lifetime that you remember? How old were you at the time?</p>

			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What was your very first job? How long did you have it?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">My very 1st job out of law school was working as a Post-Bar Certified Law Clerk at the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office in the Public Integrity division, where I provided support in the case against Ronald Rizzo, the then-mayor Bell at the time, who had embezzled money from the government into his personal funds and relations. I worked here for several months before then changing jobs to work as a litigator at a small boutique litigation firm in Pasadena. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What is your favorite book? Why?</p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">What was the last song that got stuck in your head?</p>

				<p class=""survey-response"">My own personal struggles involve reconciling my relationship and communication with my parents as I came out of the closet to them in February 2018 and as they don't accept, and it's been rough since. But we all trust that everything will work out and that we can happily coexist and love each other as family, despite our differences. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What qualities does the U.S. House of Representatives possess that makes it unique as an institution?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">The U.S. House of Representatives is directly representative of each district that makes up our country, and it's beautiful to see how each district in the U.S., no matter from what part, is equally represented by its representative - but that's if the representative really does truly represent the people and fight for its interests, and not those of its corporate donors. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Do you believe that it's beneficial for representatives to have previous experience in government or politics?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">It's beneficial but it's not a requirement at all. Our career politicians are the ones who have gotten us into this mess of a 30-year wage stagnation, 30-year income disparity, overwhelming student debt, housing crisis and more. Insanity is repeating the same thing over and over again and expecting different results. And to expect our career politicians to do better is insanity. We need fresh blood, that is directly of, by and for the people, to be elected into office, who has no allegiance to any corporation, bank, healthcare company, pharmaceutical company, real estate firm, etc.. so he/she can effectively work on and behalf of the PEOPLE. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What do you perceive to be the United States’ greatest challenges as a nation over the next decade?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Fighting Climate Change will be our greatest challenge if we don't quickly act now to save our country and planet from Climate Change. We only have a decade left and we must act now and implement BIG policies for change, with at least something like the Green New Deal in place. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Do you believe that two years is the right term length for representatives?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Yes</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What are your thoughts on term limits?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">We should DEFINITELY place term limits for U.S. of House Representatives!</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Both sitting representatives and candidates for office hear many personal stories from the residents of their district. Is there a story that you’ve heard that you found particularly touching, memorable, or impactful?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">There's a family in our building, with four children, and the father leaves around 8pm at night to go to work, and returns the next morning in 7am, while the mother then leaves around 8am in the morning and comes home at 7pm. And they do this every day. Imagine! The children rarely get to spend time with both of their parents at the same time. Why? What's happened? America is not the placed it used to be or professes itself it be.</p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">Who are you? Tell us about yourself in 300 words or less.</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">As a life-long resident of the Monterey Peninsula, I appreciate the beauty and community we enjoy in the 20th Congressional District of California.  Serving the community as Representative to the National Capitol would be a tremendous honor.  I believe in the power of America.  And my belief in a healthy private economy has grown to be a passion.

From early in life, I recall pondering the totalitarian politics manifest during World War II by socialist governments in Italy and Germany.  How could that happen?  Throughout my childhood, we lived for years under threat of nuclear war with organized International Communism under the Soviets.  How could they think Communism would work?  And now, we face another tremendous challenge to the American Way of Life:  the current state-run Corporatism of today's China.

America is the leader of the Free World.  We must accept that mantle.  We must not appease malicious threats to navigation of trade.  We must not accede to terrorism.    And we must identify the threat of state-led industrial espionage by powers who are not our friends.</p>
			</div>
						    <div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Please list below 3 key messages of your campaign. What are the main points you want voters to remember about your goals for your time in office?</p>
				<ul class=""key-messages"">
					<li>A strong economy helps all of our other priorities</li>
					<li>National security is the primary reason for having a Federal Government</li>
					<li>The US economy is great because of our industrious people and our freedoms, especially to keep private property.  Local, State and Federal government must be reminded to respect our rights!</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
							<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What areas of public policy are you personally passionate about?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Industrial Policy
National Security</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What was your very first job? How long did you have it?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I was a paperboy from when I was 11 to 14 years old.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What qualities does the U.S. House of Representatives possess that makes it unique as an institution?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">The US House of Representatives has an important obligation.  It holds the 'power of the purse.'  Balancing the budget of the Federal Government has slipped off the current House Leadership's agenda.  Similarly, appropriating the funds to the budget must be timely.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What do you perceive to be the United States’ greatest challenges as a nation over the next decade?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">One of the biggest challenges we face is turning over a country to the next generation, who may not understand why socialism is not the same as society.  We face an onslaught of surveillance never before seen.  It is the stuff of science fiction and dystopia, like 1984.   Taming technology to allow for human dignity and privacy must be achieved to preserve the American tradition of Freedom.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Do you believe that two years is the right term length for representatives?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Yes.  The House is the place most responsive to the mood of the people.  The two year cycle gives the people a chance to make a change, and to change back, when considering priorities.  The Presidency and the US Senate, with longer terms, allow for less reactive, more deliberate leadership.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Is there a particular representative, past or present, whom you want to model yourself after?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I would like to help Kevin McCarthy balance the budget when he becomes Speaker in 2021!</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Both sitting representatives and candidates for office hear many personal stories from the residents of their district. Is there a story that you’ve heard that you found particularly touching, memorable, or impactful?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Yes, there is.  However, it is quite confidential.  I would cast a little light, though, on the need for the Federal Government to stick to the General Welfare, when it comes to domestic politics.  We have a robust system with States who must balance their budgets and are charged with many human service roles.   The Federal Government takes responsibility for National Security, monetary policy, border control and citizenship and health threats to the Nation as a whole.  Making the Federal Government responsible for health outcomes of individuals turns the idea of Federalism on its head.</p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">Who are you? Tell us about yourself in 300 words or less.</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">As a single mother, it is important to me to be involved in my community. When the issue of building homeless shelters near our schools was presented, I was concerned.  I turned to our local leaders for information, but I was given misleading information and lies.  

There are solutions to many of the problems Los Angeles is currently facing, but our leadership continues to lead us down the wrong path.  We need to implement plans that restore our community's safety, by providing solutions for homelessness that addresses the root causes.  We must support local businesses and economic growth, support our law enforcement, provide a sustainable increase in affordable housing, 

In an effort to ensure that my neighborhood has access to truthful, unbiased information regarding all plans proposed for our community, I co-founded an online community bulletin. I attend and participate in our neighborhood council meetings and home-owners association meetings, and other council meetings in surrounding areas. I have researched and met with several homeless housing and care providers in order to establish best practices that ensure effective outcomes. I have worked as a volunteer on Skid Row, and I am advocate for the protection of animals, and our environment.  I participate in the ongoing meetings with the FAA and community members that are affected by the change in flight paths. I've researched and met with traffic mapping app programmers to find effective solutions to Los Angeles.</p>
