				<p class=""survey-question"">Who are you? Tell us about yourself in 300 words or less.</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">My name is David Kim, and I'm a committed, courageous and trusting leader. I am a 2nd generation Asian American who currently works as a music attorney in the film industry, while serving as a Board Member on the MacArthur Park Neighborhood Council. And my goal is to achieve financial freedom for every American as it doesn't make sense for us to have 2-3 jobs just to make ends meet. And that's why I'm running for Congress: to provide a Universal Basic Income of 1K/month, to provide free Universal Medicare, to provide free public college and higher education, to cancel student debt on a one-time basis and to ban politicians like our current Congressman (Jimmy Gomez) from accepting and pocketing corporate donations. Additionally, we need to fight Climate Change and implement BIG policies for change, in implementing a Green New Deal and infrastructure to save our planet, country and people, abolish ICE, establish a US Citizenship Track Program for Undocumented Workers, Mass Decarceration, Gun Control and more.</p>

				<p class=""survey-response"">The core responsibilities for someone elected to this office is to: (1) vow not to accept any corporate donations or money because doing so taints one's ability to effectively think for and decide on issues in the interests of our people; (2) be deeply aware that every decision that is made is a moral decision, deeply affecting the lives of millions of Americans and shouldn't be taken lightly - even an abstention; (3) to always walk the walk, and not just talk the talk, and to be an effective, communicative leader who doesn't waver; and (4) to be deeply aware and realize that not one soul is less than another in any way</p>

				<p class=""survey-response"">I would like to leave a legacy where masses of positive, loving change agents who don't compromise the interests of our people, continue to rise up and take the initiative in protecting our communities and really living for the people, and not for corporate interests, power or short term maximization of profits. </p>

			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What qualities does the U.S. House of Representatives possess that makes it unique as an institution?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">The U.S. House of Representatives is directly representative of each district that makes up our country, and it's beautiful to see how each district in the U.S., no matter from what part, is equally represented by its representative - but that's if the representative really does truly represent the people and fight for its interests, and not those of its corporate donors. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Do you believe that it's beneficial for representatives to have previous experience in government or politics?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">It's beneficial but it's not a requirement at all. Our career politicians are the ones who have gotten us into this mess of a 30-year wage stagnation, 30-year income disparity, overwhelming student debt, housing crisis and more. Insanity is repeating the same thing over and over again and expecting different results. And to expect our career politicians to do better is insanity. We need fresh blood, that is directly of, by and for the people, to be elected into office, who has no allegiance to any corporation, bank, healthcare company, pharmaceutical company, real estate firm, etc.. so he/she can effectively work on and behalf of the PEOPLE. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What do you perceive to be the United States’ greatest challenges as a nation over the next decade?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Fighting Climate Change will be our greatest challenge if we don't quickly act now to save our country and planet from Climate Change.

			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Do you believe that two years is the right term length for representatives?</p>

			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What are your thoughts on term limits?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">We should DEFINITELY place term limits for U.S. of House Representatives!</p>

					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Both sitting representatives and candidates for office hear many personal stories from the residents of their district. Is there a story that you’ve heard that you found particularly touching, memorable, or impactful?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">There's a family in our building, with four children, and the father leaves around 8pm at night to go to work, and returns the next morning in 7am, while the mother then leaves around 8am in the morning and comes home at 7pm. And they do this every day. Imagine! The children rarely get to spend time with both of their parents at the same time. Why? What's happened? America is not the placed it used to be or professes itself it be.</p>

No candidate is more devoted to providing affordable, quality education to our children than I am, and my lifelong commitment to education show that. I built my company to help students, mostly public school students, get the education they need to compete in a global economy.
</p><p>For years we’ve listened to politicians say they want to improve education, but nothing changes.
</p><p>Together, we can change it. We have the resources to make American schools among the best in the world, but for too long we haven’t made it a priority. I will work to change that.
</p><p>College tuition should be within the reach of every student. Students should not be burdened by endless college loan debt. Our taxes pay for our state universities, yet many cannot afford to attend them. An educated workforce is the foundation of our economy and our best hope for a prosperous future. In Washington, I will continue my fight for quality education for every child.
</p><p><b>Affordable Healthcare</b><br>
Members of Congress are given excellent healthcare coverage for themselves and their families, yet they refuse to provide the same to us. Representative Woodall happily accepts health care that you pay for, yet he refuses to fix the system for you. Until Congress takes up serious reform to fix our healthcare system, I won’t accept this taxpayer funded benefit until you have access to coverage as well. As a business owner, I have always paid for health coverage for my employees, and as a Member of Congress, I will work to ensure all Americans have access to quality, affordable coverage.
</p><p>For eight years, we heard the cries of repeal of the Affordable Care act, but when the time came, Congress had no plan. Millions of dollars paid by Georgia taxpayers are sent to other states that expanded Medicaid, but because Georgia failed to expand Medicaid, our tax dollars are not even helping our own citizens have access to healthcare. I will vote to expand coverage, better serve the physical and mental health of our Veterans, and work to ensure that a serious medical issue doesn’t have to become a serious financial issue for my fellow Americans. Healthcare is a complicated issue, but we can fix this, and the time to start is now.
</p><p><b>Gun Law Reform</b>
We can protect our rights and find ways to work together on solutions to keep us safe. But we need some common sense. I believe the vast majority of gun owners are safe and responsible gun owners and take their role as good citizens seriously. I believe these responsible gun owners can help us find the solutions that have eluded us for too long.
</p><p>That’s why when I’m elected to Congress I promise to reach across the aisle and work with responsible gun owners to find cultural, technological, and legal ways that we can make this country safer for everyone, but it’s not going to be easy. No matter what side of this issue you’re on, we have to stop addressing this issue from a place of anger and fear, and start discussing it with facts and respect for our fellow Americans. There are no easy answers when it comes to making our families safer from gun violence, but if we work together we will find that there are innovations and common sense solutions hiding in plain sight.
</p><p>I will vote to pass reasonable gun reform: universal background checks to keep guns out of the hands of violent criminals and domestic abusers, methods to prevent anyone on a terrorist watch list–or whose mental health poses a danger to themselves and others– from accessing weapons, and measures designed to keep our children safe. Congress has been silent too long.
</p><p><b>Protecting Medicare and Social Security</b><br>
We need to do more to protect our most vulnerable citizens, and I will lead the charge in Washington to do just that. The government never hesitated to take money out of your paycheck; now government must keep its word when it comes to healthcare, Social Security, and Medicare. Instead, your benefits are threatened by the reckless spending of Congress.
</p><p>To our senior citizens:you earned and paid for your benefits, and I will never vote to break that contract. We have seen Washington tap into the Social Security Trust Fund, putting every American at risk of losing benefits. We have seen them run up huge deficits and then cry for a balanced budget. This must stop.
</p><p>The best indicator of character is how you treat people who can’t offer you anything in return.I will bring compassionate leadership back to Washington.
</p><p><b>Fiscal Responsibility</b><br>
We listened to the promises of Republicans to put our fiscal house in order and give tax relief to working families. Despite their promises, they increased the deficit by over 2 trillion dollars just in the last two months. Very simply put, we are borrowing trillions from China and letting our children deal with the consequences. By the time my daughter reaches middle school, the national debt will be more than 30 trillion dollars. This is fiscal insanity, coming from people who call themselves conservatives.
</p><p>We should be focused on building a better future. I will support renewed investment in national infrastructure, protections for our vulnerable electric grid, and making sure we never again leave over three million Americans without power or water for months as we did in Puerto Rico. I support ideas to let younger Americans consolidate their student loan debt–or have it forgiven in exchange for public service–so that they can become full participants in the American economy. And I will support tax reform that benefits working families and small businesses instead of giveaways for billionaires and corporate welfare.
</p><p>For too long Congress has refused to spend OUR money on the things we need, and I will do better. I will vote to restore fiscal responsibility, and I will vote to stop spending our children’s inheritance.
</p><p><b>Immigration Reform</b><br>
In March, I sat down with several Dreamers to hear their stories. One Dreamer, Aldo Mendoza-Guerra, said “The place we were born is foreign to us. The place we were raised looks at us like foreigners.” Over 80% of Americans want to protect the Dreamers; they came to this country as children through no fault of their own and are as American as anyone born on this soil.
</p><p>We have not had immigration reform since Ronald Reagan was president. The world has changed but we remain stuck in the failed policies of the past while millions continue to live in the shadows. We can protect our borders, maintain our national security and join together to address this pressing issue. We cannot allow fear to drive policy.
</p><p>I will vote to protect the Dreamers and to give them a path to citizenship. I will vote to enable those who want to contribute to our great American melting pot to come here legally and safely. The state of immigration in the United States is a human tragedy that is destroying innocent lives and threatening the education, employment, and safety of young people. Enough is enough. If we want to be seen as a country of great opportunity, we must start acting like one, and I will make it my priority to lead the charge for smarter immigration laws.
</p><p><b>Women’s Rights</b><br>
The Republicans have mounted an unprecedented attack on the rights of women. While we hear Republicans call for less government and more personal freedom, we watch them try to restrict women’s rights, to limit life-saving research, and to withhold funding for organizations like Planned Parenthood that treat thousands of women each year. The decision to have a child is a sacred decision only a woman can make. Why does the party of individualism and small government want to control your body?
</p><p>I led by example in my company, C2 Education, and I will do the same in Washington. Women always received equal pay for equal work, were hired and promoted because of their abilities, and all employees received paid medical leave. I worked hard to make sure women felt safe and respected in the workplace. I will continue to fight for your right to equal healthcare, equal pay, and equal representation.
</p><p><b>Environmental Protection</b><br>
Too many in Congress are preventing us from developing safer, cleaner and cheaper energy. We are the most innovative nation on earth, yet we are missing out on hugely profitable advancements in clean energy.
</p><p>Let’s put our communities to work to make us more energy efficient, grow our economy, and to protect our planet from the special interests who don’t care about our future. The United States should lead the world in the development of smart development, clean energy, and “green-collar” jobs. We can create thousands of jobs, and put people to work protecting our environment, building clean alternative energy sources, and securing a place for America as a global leader in the green revolution.
</p><p><b>Net Neutrality</b><br>
The Federal Communications Commission voted to end net neutrality, meaning your equal access to the open Internet that has become a mainstay in everyone’s life is at risk. If Congress does not act, net neutrality is history and your open access to millions of web sites and services will be cut off unless you pay to play. Congress could stop this from happening, but, like so much else, they do nothing. Equal access to knowledge is essential to a prosperous, equitable future. I was the first candidate to speak out forcefully and take a strong position on net neutrality, and as your representative, I will champion our right to an internet that is open to all.
</p><p><b>Georgia Agriculture and Our Family Farms</b><br>
The family farm is the backbone of America. Here in Georgia agriculture is our largest industry. Our farmers compete in a world market where the playing field is not level and the price of commodities is not based on the cost of production. I believe in parity for our producers, and open markets for our products.
</p><p>The President has said that he believes a trade war will be good for our economy, but in reality, it will hurt farmers and devastate rural communities. Closed markets drive down the prices of all our agricultural products by limiting demand. If we lose our ability to sell to other countries, we risk never getting our market share again. I will work to protect our farmers and our rural communities and keep our agricultural economy strong by promoting fair trade partnerships, open markets, and financial support for our growers.

</p><p>There’s more common ground to be found on the issues than people think — after all, we all want our community to have good-paying jobs, strong public schools, and affordable health care. My thoughts below are just the start of a longer conversation. I’m always looking for your input, click here to take our issues survey to let me know where you stand.
</p><p>JOBS AND THE ECONOMY
</p><p>Rebuilding our region means creating jobs. I understand the importance of sustainable, good paying jobs. My parents worked for General Electric before most of those jobs disappeared. I will push for banks to lend to small businesses so they can expand and create the jobs we need. I will work to draw investments and businesses to the district, including those in growth industries like tech and clean energy so that we can match the trained workers to the businesses that need them. I will fight for policies that reward investment and job creation in the district, not outsourcing. And I will oppose any trade agreements that are not beneficial to our region or to American workers.
</p><p>Protecting the jobs of the hundreds of thousands of teachers, healthcare workers, service workers, farmers, and factory workers in the district, requires investing in those industries and communities, and protecting the resources upon which they rely. I want to ensure that local small businesses are no longer crippled by regulations while massive corporations play by their own set of rules. I will be an ally to small businesses, workers, and labor unions, not big corporations and special interests. And I will fight to increase the minimum wage.
</p><p>HEALTHCARE
</p><p>I understand that access to healthcare means nothing if no one can actually afford to pay for it, and that our small businesses have struggled to meet the health insurance needs of their employees.  I will fight for a healthcare system that addresses rising premiums and deductibles, protects people with pre-existing conditions, and provides real coverage to everyone. I support the goal of getting the profit motive out of our health care system. My goal is to get us to universal coverage as fast as possible, and the best way to do that is by creating a public option, giving everyone the choice to opt into Medicare. I will also work to eliminate regulations that protect the pharmaceutical companies at the expense of the health of everyday Americans, and will work to give Medicare the power to negotiate drug prices.
</p><p>Congressman John Faso has spent his time in Washington D.C. working to take health insurance away from millions of Americans for no reason other than to create a huge tax giveaway to the wealthiest one percent.  Faso’s plan hurts people with pre-existing conditions. He will tell you pre-existing conditions are still covered, but his plan lets insurance companies force people with pre-existing conditions into totally unaffordable plans called high-risk pools, and the truth is that no plan is truly “accessible” if it’s not affordable.  Furthermore, Faso’s plan cruelly strips Medicaid away from thousands of the most vulnerable families, and slashes funding for women’s health organizations like Planned Parenthood, despite his promises that he would not do so.
</p><p>TAX POLICY
</p><p>Working people pay enough taxes.  America’s tax policies should put working families and the middle class first, not the super-rich and large corporations. I vehemently oppose the proposed tax policies of President Trump and John Faso, and any other policy that funnels tax dollars from the middle class to billionaires and contributes to an already exploding federal debt.  Trickle-down economics has never worked for the American people. I want to simplify our tax code and get rid of the loopholes that are only available to the super rich. I will also fight to stop big companies from shielding their profits overseas.
</p><p>EDUCATION
</p><p>For most of my childhood, I was educated in the public school system of upstate New York.  I understand that a high-quality public education is the key to creating opportunities that will allow our children to realize the American dream.  As my parents taught me, it is the great equalizer and the gateway to opportunity. Along with many of our region’s educators, school boards, parents, and students, I oppose the appointment of Betsy DeVos as Secretary of Education.  I believe that our children are our greatest resource, but for years, they have been treated like failing commodities.  We need to invest in public education to make sure that all of our children get the education they deserve. For those who dream of going to college, I will work to make college more affordable for every member of our district, by expanding Pell Grants and increasing opportunities for student loan forgiveness and relief.  That means new opportunities both for high school kids as well as folks who want to go to college later in life.
</p><p>Lastly, while college was my ticket to building a better life for my family, many kids see a different future for themselves.  College should not be the only way to the middle class.  Our community needs to reinvest in trade and vocational schools and apprenticeship programs that teach our kids the real world skills that they need to get good-paying jobs—the kind that used to be enough to build a good life, with a home, family, and savings for retirement.
</p><p>ENVIRONMENT
</p><p>Upstate New York is known for its natural beauty, and we rely on the natural resources of this region for both personal use and industry. I want to ensure that our environmental policies and regulations protect our land and waterways for the boaters, hunters, fishers, hikers, and sightseers who enjoy our rivers and waterways, our mountains, and our forests year-round – as well as the merchants who rely on servicing these pastimes for their livelihoods. For example, the Delaware River generates over $400 million of economic value to our region. Protecting our waterways is both a moral imperative and a sound economic policy. Faso’s decision to overturn the Stream Protection Rule and jeopardize our water quality is an example of exactly what our political leaders should not be doing. We need to preserve and protect the Clean Water Act and defend the Clean Water Rule in order to prevent pollution and destruction of our natural resources. With the importance of tourism to our local businesses, policies like these not only undermine the quality of our environment, but also endanger the health of our economy.
</p><p>The impact of climate change on our environment is undeniable. It is imperative that we work together to mitigate the factors causing extreme and often unpredictable weather conditions.
</p><p>I will also work to protect our rivers and waterways from proposals such as the recent plan to establish new anchorages for oil tankers near communities like Kingston. I will also fight to ensure that communities like Hoosick Falls never face a water crisis like the one they’ve faced over the past few years, and that none of our residents are exposed to contaminated water. Finally, I do not believe that job creation and environmental conservation need to be in conflict. Clean energy is one of the fastest growing sectors of our economy, and I will do everything I can to encourage the growth of clean energy jobs in our region by fighting to shift tax credits and subsidies away from the fossil fuel industry to the renewable energy space.
</p><p>INFRASTRUCTURE
</p><p>Our region of upstate New York presents countless opportunities for investment in infrastructure.  I will work to obtain federal funding to finance local construction projects that will create both short-term and long-term jobs, and improve the lives of those who live here. The President has talked tough about pushing for a bipartisan infrastructure bill, but has indicated that he intends to offer tax breaks for privatized projects rather than funding public works.  I oppose such a giveaway to corporations, which favors corporate profits over community needs, and incentivizes companies to build as little as possible rather than undertaking the robust development that we need here in our region.  We need to bid those contracts out in a fair process that lets small businesses actually compete and results in lasting improvements to our shared facilities and services.
</p><p>I will seek funding for projects that address the most immediate needs and that serve the greatest public good, including repairs for the Taconic Parkway, development of our public waterfront, investment in high speed rail for Metro North, and wider access to broadband internet and quality cell service in the rural areas of our district.
</p><p>WOMEN'S RIGHTS
</p><p>I support women’s rights to make their own health care decisions.  Unlike Congressman John Faso, who has called Roe v. Wade a “black mark upon this country,” and voted for a health care bill that defunded Planned Parenthood, I will fight to defend women’s rights from an assault by the current President and Republican-led Congress. I also strongly support opposing any use of taxpayer money for settlements in sexual harassment suits.
</p><p>I will also work to ensure that women earn equal pay for equal work.  It is deeply troubling that Faso repeatedly voted against equal pay while a member of the New York State Assembly; his is not a voting record consistent with the values of our region.
</p><p>LGBTQ+ RIGHTS
</p><p>Every member of our community, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity, deserves the right to live with dignity and free from discrimination. These basic rights are at the core of our American values. I stand as a strong ally to our LGBTQ+ communities and I will fight to ensure equal rights are both protected and promoted. Despite important strides made in the fight for LGBTQ+ equality in recent years, the current Administration is taking profoundly disturbing steps to try and turn back the clock on our most basic human rights. I will continue moving forward to expand equal rights for LGBTQ+ communities, especially in areas like healthcare, housing, employment, and education. I fully support legislation like the Equality Act, which would further ban discrimination, and I would proudly defend marriage equality.
</p><p>FARMING AND AGRICULTURE
</p><p>The farmers in our district have been forced to endure the detrimental impacts of bad trade policies and an unfair Farm Bill. Our district is home to more than 5,000 farms and over 8,000 farm operators. Almost 20% of the land that makes up New York’s 19th is dedicated to farmland. We need to work together to protect our small and medium sized farms and the farming industry while also building out the necessary regional infrastructure to ensure that our farmers are able to have access to the $6 billion dollars of unmet demand for local and organically grown food in New York City.
</p><p>The version of the Farm Bill passed by the House Agriculture Committee, of which John Faso is a member, gives the wealthiest 3% of farmers 40% of the subsidies. It adds loopholes allowing mega farms to collect millions of dollars a year in subsidies and it does this by cutting funding for conservation, risk management and outreach programs that would improve farming for our next generation.
</p><p>I will work to protect our local farms, making sure that necessary subsidies reach the people who actually need it. Farmers I’ve talked with in our district have told me they don’t want aid, they just want to earn a livable income from their business. We should help them by passing legislation to conserve and protect our environment, provide access to credit and business training for small rural farms, invest in preparing the next generation of farmers in our community, and fund programs like SNAP and those incentivizing purchases at local farmer’s markets.
</p><p>I am committed to listening to our local farmers and working hard to make sure their needs are put before those of any mega farm or big corporation.
</p><p>IMMIGRATION
</p><p>I believe that we are a nation of immigrants, and that our region can benefit from a sensible and compassionate immigration policy.  I understand that immigrants come to this region to fill important roles in every industry, ranging from the physicians who come to work at rural hospitals to the seasonal workers our farmers rely upon to bring in the harvest.  How we treat our immigrant population should illustrate our highest ideals of who we are as Americans and New Yorkers. I will fight for immigration policies that reflect the character and decency of the people of upstate New York – this means passing a clean Dream Act and achieving bipartisan legislation that fixes our broken immigration system.
</p><p>OPIOID ABUSE
</p><p>The impact of the opioid epidemic on our communities has been devastating. Opioid dependency does not discriminate, and I have heard countless stories of painful addiction and heartbreaking loss from people of all backgrounds, income levels, race, and age.
</p><p>One in four New Yorkers knows someone who has died after overdosing on opioids and more than half have been directly touched by opioid abuse. With rates of overdose in our region continuing to rise and more and more lives being stolen each day, there is no denying that this is an urgent crisis and one that requires us to forge solutions by working together.  Our elected leaders, long negligent and absent, must lead decisively and immediately.
</p><p>The first change must come from us all—we must remove the stigma of judgment and punishment that burdens so many struggling with opiates and instead shift towards a compassionate focus on treatment and reform. In Congress, I will enact policies that promote treatment over incarceration, appropriate federal dollars for programs oriented towards delivering addicts to detox centers, and ensure Medicaid funding for drug treatment facilities. We must also hold drug manufacturers accountable for knowingly marketing these highly addictive substances which directly contributed to their overprescribing and abuse.
</p><p>I am committed to expanding programs like Chatham Cares 4 U, which build coalitions between law enforcement, medical professionals, and everyday citizens. Our region—and our country—has suffered for far too long from the impact of opioids, our economy hindered by a stunted workforce, our families torn apart by the loss of loved ones. It is crucial that our leaders finally take action, confronting opioids with courage and action rather than continued complacency.
</p><p>CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM
</p><p>As a lawyer who has donated countless hours of pro-bono services to people and communities of need, and juveniles given life sentences in particular, I recognize criminal justice reform as one of the most pressing issues of our time.  For too long, our lawmakers have enacted ineffective policies in a failing war on drugs, while countless families in our region have lost loved ones to addiction. In recent years, our district has been one of the regions hit hardest by the rising opioid epidemic, and its costs have been born by all of us, regardless of race, economic status, or political party.
</p><p>We need to reform the system to account for this harsh reality.  I will work with healthcare professionals and other experts to enact policies that treat rather than criminalize drug addiction.  I will fight to increase funding for proven alternatives to incarceration, including treatment programs, drug courts, and mental health courts.
</p><p>I’ve also seen firsthand how mass incarceration affects our communities. I believe we need to end mandatory minimum sentences, and ban private prisons—there is no room for a profit motive in incarceration. We need to have a system that focuses on rehabilitation, not just incarceration. We should also have clemency programs to give people second chances.
</p><p>Additionally, the Department of Justice needs to have institutionalized racial bias training. 60% of people in NY State prisons have not be convicted of a crime, and we need bail reform to fix that shameful number. Prosecutors shouldn’t be instructed to seek the highest sentences.
</p><p>It is time that we face this crisis head on, with empathy, not animus; with ideas, not impulse; and with courage, not politics.
</p><p>DEMOCRATIC INTEGRITY
</p><p>I am deeply concerned that our democracy has been under assault in recent years.  A small minority of the super-rich and powerful have sought to control our elections using dark money, massive redistricting efforts, and campaigns to repress voter rights.  Simultaneously, our President has expressed his contempt for the Constitution both by questioning the role of the Judicial Branch and by lining his pockets with payments from foreign powers in violation of the Emoluments Clause.  I believe that we need to immediately fight to preserve the integrity of our Democracy, by pushing for reform to address Citizens United, gerrymandering, and the restriction of voters’ rights.  We also need to uphold the Voting Rights Act, and restore Section Five, to ensure every American citizen has an equal opportunity to vote. I will work to eliminate corruption and cronyism in Washington D.C.
</p><p>RUSSIA AND OUR ELECTIONS
</p><p>In 2016, according to the unanimous, nonpartisan opinion of all 17 U.S. intelligence agencies, the government of Russia stole private information from American citizens, ensured that information was published, and spread targeted fake news stories on American social media. The goal of these new and disturbing tactics was to undermine the credibility of our election and ensure that President Trump was elected.
</p><p>There are ongoing federal investigations into the nature of Russia’s attack on our democracy and whether the Trump campaign worked with the Russian officials who committed these attacks. My goal is to prioritize uncovering the truth, not to politicize these necessary investigations in order to protect the President or party. Congress is a co-equal branch of government and should act like it. We need to pass legislation to protect the work of the independent Special Counsel Robert Mueller and his team. We need to fund election infrastructure and increase sanctions on Russia. I support the investigation and the ongoing work of Congress and the FBI to ensure that we may understand precisely what happened—and can prevent it from ever happening again.
</p><p>GUN SAFETY
</p><p>I respect the Second Amendment, and responsible gun owners and non-owners alike know that it goes hand in hand with commonsense solutions to reduce gun violence.  We can’t afford to keep ignoring the facts. Every day, 7 children and teens die from gun violence. Overall, 35,000 Americans are killed by guns every year. If any disease were this deadly, it would be considered a public health crisis. We need to start treating gun violence like one.
</p><p>When young people in our district held a walkout to draw attention to school safety after the tragic shooting in Parkland, Faso criticized their effort, saying it caused a “loss of valuable academic time” and added it is “better to participate in such activities after school or on weekends.” I wholeheartedly disagree with this and support young people as they ask their elected representatives to take action.
</p><p>Right now, our broken Congress does not provide any funding for the Center for Disease Control to do research on gun violence. That’s because the National Rifle Association has a chokehold on our political leaders, including John Faso. He has taken thousands of NRA dollars and continues to boast about his lifetime “A” rating from the organization.
</p><p>I won’t take a cent of their money. That’s not because I don’t respect the rights of gun owners, but because the NRA’s leadership blocks even the smallest commonsense reforms that are supported by a majority of Americans. Reforms like universal background checks and closing the gun show loophole. Or banning bump stocks, which were used in the Las Vegas shooting to make an AR-15 fire like a machine gun. Or prohibiting the sale of guns to domestic abusers. Or keeping weapons of war out of our neighborhoods, churches, theaters and schools.
</p><p>I support all of these measures, which will keep our children safe while allowing for the kind of responsible gun ownership protected by our Second Amendment. I am proud to be a Moms Demand Action Gun Sense candidate.<sup id=""cite_ref-quotedisclaimer_7-0"" class=""reference""><a href=""#cite_note-quotedisclaimer-7"">[7]</a></sup>
