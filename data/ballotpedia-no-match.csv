				<p class=""survey-response"">My name is David Kim, and I'm a committed, courageous and trusting leader. I am a 2nd generation Asian American who currently works as a music attorney in the film industry, while serving as a Board Member on the MacArthur Park Neighborhood Council. And my goal is to achieve financial freedom for every American as it doesn't make sense for us to have 2-3 jobs just to make ends meet. And that's why I'm running for Congress: to provide a Universal Basic Income of 1K/month, to provide free Universal Medicare, to provide free public college and higher education, to cancel student debt on a one-time basis and to ban politicians like our current Congressman (Jimmy Gomez) from accepting and pocketing corporate donations. Additionally, we need to fight Climate Change and implement BIG policies for change, in implementing a Green New Deal and infrastructure to save our planet, country and people, abolish ICE, establish a US Citizenship Track Program for Undocumented Workers, Mass Decarceration, Gun Control and more.</p>

			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What do you believe are the core responsibilities for someone elected to this office?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">The core responsibilities for someone elected to this office is to: (1) vow not to accept any corporate donations or money because doing so taints one's ability to effectively think for and decide on issues in the interests of our people; (2) be deeply aware that every decision that is made is a moral decision, deeply affecting the lives of millions of Americans and shouldn't be taken lightly - even an abstention; (3) to always walk the walk, and not just talk the talk, and to be an effective, communicative leader who doesn't waver; and (4) to be deeply aware and realize that not one soul is less than another in any way</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What legacy would you like to leave?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I would like to leave a legacy where masses of positive, loving change agents who don't compromise the interests of our people, continue to rise up and take the initiative in protecting our communities and really living for the people, and not for corporate interests, power or short term maximization of profits. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What is the first historical event that happened in your lifetime that you remember? How old were you at the time?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I remember in 1st grade writing penpal letters to U.S. soldiers who were fighting in the Iraq War. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What was your very first job? How long did you have it?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">My very 1st job out of law school was working as a Post-Bar Certified Law Clerk at the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office in the Public Integrity division, where I provided support in the case against Ronald Rizzo, the then-mayor Bell at the time, who had embezzled money from the government into his personal funds and relations. I worked here for several months before then changing jobs to work as a litigator at a small boutique litigation firm in Pasadena. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What is your favorite book? Why?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Currently, The Four Agreements by Don Miguel Ruiz because it's so helpful and true (content/conclusions)!</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">If you could be any fictional character, who would you want to be?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Superman</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What was the last song that got stuck in your head?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Sheryl Crow - Soak Up The Son</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What is something that has been a struggle in your life?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">My own personal struggles involve reconciling my relationship and communication with my parents as I came out of the closet to them in February 2018 and as they don't accept, and it's been rough since. But we all trust that everything will work out and that we can happily coexist and love each other as family, despite our differences. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What qualities does the U.S. House of Representatives possess that makes it unique as an institution?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">The U.S. House of Representatives is directly representative of each district that makes up our country, and it's beautiful to see how each district in the U.S., no matter from what part, is equally represented by its representative - but that's if the representative really does truly represent the people and fight for its interests, and not those of its corporate donors. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Do you believe that it's beneficial for representatives to have previous experience in government or politics?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">It's beneficial but it's not a requirement at all. Our career politicians are the ones who have gotten us into this mess of a 30-year wage stagnation, 30-year income disparity, overwhelming student debt, housing crisis and more. Insanity is repeating the same thing over and over again and expecting different results. And to expect our career politicians to do better is insanity. We need fresh blood, that is directly of, by and for the people, to be elected into office, who has no allegiance to any corporation, bank, healthcare company, pharmaceutical company, real estate firm, etc.. so he/she can effectively work on and behalf of the PEOPLE. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What do you perceive to be the United States’ greatest challenges as a nation over the next decade?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Fighting Climate Change will be our greatest challenge if we don't quickly act now to save our country and planet from Climate Change. We only have a decade left and we must act now and implement BIG policies for change, with at least something like the Green New Deal in place. </p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Do you believe that two years is the right term length for representatives?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Yes</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What are your thoughts on term limits?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">We should DEFINITELY place term limits for U.S. of House Representatives!</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Both sitting representatives and candidates for office hear many personal stories from the residents of their district. Is there a story that you’ve heard that you found particularly touching, memorable, or impactful?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">There's a family in our building, with four children, and the father leaves around 8pm at night to go to work, and returns the next morning in 7am, while the mother then leaves around 8am in the morning and comes home at 7pm. And they do this every day. Imagine! The children rarely get to spend time with both of their parents at the same time. Why? What's happened? America is not the placed it used to be or professes itself it be.</p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">What would be your top three priorities, if elected?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">The issues we face as a society are interconnected and therefor, require interconnected solutions. Within the 7th district &amp; beyond, hard working community members are struggling to keep a roof over their heads, food on their tables, &amp; their loved ones safe from violence. In order to directly address these issues, our top priorities are to ensure that everyone has a fundamental right to housing, everyone has a fundamental right to medical care, &amp; that everyone has a fundamental right to an education, as well as employment that pays a livable wage.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What areas of public policy are you personally passionate about?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">As issues are interconnected, I am passionate about all policies &amp; look to improve in areas of knowledge, as well as ability to be an ally in verb form on a daily basis. In saying that, the areas of public policy that I am most passionate about, that I believe will lead to the type of systemic change that will empower the people are, our environmental policy, education policy, criminal justice policy, defense policy, civil rights, &amp; drug policy.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Who do you look up to? Whose example would you like to follow, and why?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I look up to my mother and father. My parents are selfless individuals who have dedicated their lives to providing, as well as creating opportunity for myself and others. They purposefully exposed me to all aspects of life so that I could experience and learn firsthand how wealth disparities and demographics help to determine an individual’s possibilities. 

My parents went without food, so that I would not go hungry. They went without material things, so that I could obtain a quality education. My mother and father worked countless hours, so that I would not go without a roof over my head. Their level of sacrifice has shaped who I am as a person and I truly believe that service to others is the rent we pay for room here on this Earth.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Is there a book, essay, film, or something else you would recommend to someone who wants to understand your political philosophy?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">If I could pick one publication that I believe best encompasses this movement &amp; my philosophy, it would be The War On Neighborhoods, Policing, Prison, &amp; Punishment in a Divided City by: Ryan Lugalia-Hollon &amp; Daniel Cooper. 

The opening of the text provides a quotes from Charles Mills, The Racial Contract, ""Without the will required to see that which is obscured, we will continue to produce &amp; reproduce human beings &amp; social relationships rooted in inequality &amp; captivity.""

I believe that Anthony Clark 2020 campaign is about speaking 'truth to power,' while educating &amp; empowering community members to not only no longer accept status quo, but to end it &amp; realize  a society of equality, free from captivity.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What characteristics or principles are most important for an elected official?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I believe good elected officials are genuine, honest, compassionate, aware of their strengths &amp; weaknesses, individuals who can follow, strong communicators, leaders with clear visions, strong listeners, individuals with empathy, &amp; individuals who value diversity.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What qualities do you possess that you believe would make you a successful officeholder?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I believe that I am a hard working, honest, genuine, &amp; compassionate person who recognizes &amp; celebrates the importance of diversity. I have dedicated my life to working within intersectional movements as an ally in verb form, as well as directly oppressed in efforts to realize systemic change. 

I am focused on the empowerment of others, not myself.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What do you believe are the core responsibilities for someone elected to this office?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">The founders wanted the House to be the legislative chamber closest to the people. In my opinion, it is impossible to be closest to the people, if as an elected official my core responsibilities are not based on listening to, working with, &amp; fighting alongside the people for their empowerment. There should be no other influence beyond the will of the people I represent.

No policy should be created, supported, or voted on without efforts to educate, learn from, &amp; work with the people to ensure said policy is in the best interest of the people.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What legacy would you like to leave?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I would love to leave a legacy of systemic change. As a collective, those who believe in human rights, including myself have failed to change individual aspects of our overall system, which I believe is built on a foundation of White Supremacy. I want to leave a legacy that clearly communicates I stood in solidarity &amp; fought with those who accomplished an entire system change in which all people have access to life, liberty, justice, happiness, &amp; opportunity.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What is the first historical event that happened in your lifetime that you remember? How old were you at the time?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">The first historical event I can vividly remember is the violent beating of Rodney King by Los Angeles Police Department officers in 1991. I was 9 years old glued to the television screen with my parents as reports of the incident poured in. That was the first time I truly ever feared the police &amp; from that moment, felt that I nor anyone else should have those feelings.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What was your very first job? How long did you have it?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">My parents believed in instilling strong values in me. I obtained my hard work ethic from both my mother &amp; father. My first two jobs were at the age of 14. My mother signed a work permit for me &amp; I worked part-time at a local pet store, as well as senior citizen building cleaning &amp; organizing. I maintained both those jobs until the age of 16, when I was hired at a local grocery store.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What was the last song that got stuck in your head?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I recently watched The Two Killings of Sam Cooke on Netflix. Sam was a true force to be reckoned with &amp; his song, A Change is Gonna Come, is stuck in my head on a daily basis. For me, the song not only serves as a 'battle cry,' of empowerment, but also as a testament of what true courage looks like. Sam was a crossover success &amp; releasing such a song put his success in jeopardy. However, Sam knew that in order for true change to occur, we have to be willing to risk &amp; sacrifice our own personal gain for the good of the collective. These are thoughts I continue to live by.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">If you are not a current representative, are there certain committees that you would want to be a part of?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">When I become the next representative of the 7th District, or I should say when 'we,' become the next representatives of the 7th District, as this campaign truly represents the community, the committees (most reps serve on 1 or 2) I as a representation of the people would most like to serve on are: Education &amp; Labor, Natural Resources, Veterans' Affairs, Ways &amp; Means, &amp; Oversight &amp; Reform.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What are your thoughts on term limits?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I 100% support term limits, as term limits strengthen Democracy by directly addressing the influence of incumbent politicians &amp; special interest groups that continue to ignore the will of the people. Term limits would counterbalancing incumbent advantages, ensure congressional turnover, secure independent congressional judgment, and reduce election-related incentives for wasteful government spending. 

One of the major issues within the 7th Congressional District &amp; beyond is the inability of entrenched incumbents to welcome new &amp; fresh ideas as the wills of communities change.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What process do you favor for redistricting?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I believe that redistricting is a mechanism utilized to manipulate our elections by allowing incumbent politicians to help partisan allies, hurt political enemies and choose their voters before the voters choose them. The current process is used as a means to further political goals by drawing boundaries to protect incumbents and reduce competition, rather than to ensure equal voting power and fair representation.

There are multiple reform approaches to redistricting &amp; to garner my support, the approach would have to be one that maximizes citizen participation &amp; independence from legislative pressure.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">If you are not currently a member of your party’s leadership in the U.S. House of Representatives, would you be interested in joining the leadership? If so, in what role?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I believe that leaders come in many forms, with many styles and diverse qualities. Recognizing the strengths I bring to the table in building strong coalitions as a teacher, activist, &amp; community organizer, I would look to serve as a leader in impact Democratic leadership in whatever capacity would allow me to help push for systemic change.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Is there a particular representative, past or present, whom you want to model yourself after?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">The reason I originally chose to accept the community nomination to run for office, is because in my lifetime, I have yet to meet or know of a representative, that I believed truly represented the people &amp; placed the needs of the people above party affiliations. 

As a good friend of mine who happens to be an awesome woman leader says, ""I have declared my allegiance to the issues, not to parties."" I am an individual focused on changing issues on a systemic level &amp; up until 2018, I didn't know of any representatives that truly inspired, as well as motivated me.

Now, powerful &amp; inspiring Representatives like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ayanna Pressley, &amp; Ilah Omar give me hope for the future, as well as motivate me to continue to rock the boat in a push for change in my district.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Both sitting representatives and candidates for office hear many personal stories from the residents of their district. Is there a story that you’ve heard that you found particularly touching, memorable, or impactful?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I have been a teacher for 9 years &amp; in those 9 years, I have lost numerous students to gun violence. 

In 2016, a day before his 17th birthday, Elijah Sims, a student I had grown close to was murdered due to senseless gun violence. Elijah was a young man who could brighten everyone's day with his smile &amp; who loved his family. Elijah worked a part-time job, had recently fallen in love with a classmate, &amp; was looking forward to eventually graduating high school. 

Simply by making the choice to go visit family &amp; friends in the Austin community, Elijah was an innocent bystander caught in senseless gun violence. 

Following Elijah's death, my organization held a vigil to honor his legacy. There I met Elijah's mother &amp; family. From that moment, Elijah's mother &amp; I became family &amp; we have sense dedicated ourselves to bringing his murderers to justice, while also proactively fighting to end gun violence in our society.

				<p class=""survey-question"">Who are you? Tell us about yourself in 300 words or less.</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Tom Watson is a lifelong Texan and veteran of the Vietnam War who has a deep desire to serve his community. 

He has been married for 51 years to his wife, Amanda, who is an ordained priest in the Epsicopal Church. Since 2005, Tom has practiced law with his daughter and son-in-law in Abilene.

Tom believes our local leaders should be loyal to their voters and constituents rather than a political party. He feels our current civil servants are more interested in maintaining their personal power and influence rather than helping West Texans who voted them into office.

						    <div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Please list below 3 key messages of your campaign. What are the main points you want voters to remember about your goals for your time in office?</p>
				<ul class=""key-messages"">
					<li>We must end the trade wars and ensure our farmers and ranchers have access to international markets.</li>
					<li>West Texas should lead the US in renewable energy. We must invest in infrastructure and increase wind and solar energy production in our district.</li>
					<li>The minimum wage must be increased so all Americans can afford to pay rent and raise families while working full-time.</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
							<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What areas of public policy are you personally passionate about?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I grew up on a small, cotton farm in Texas and understand what our farmers and ranchers go through everyday. As a lawyer in Abilene, I see the struggles of many of my neighbors as they try to get adequate healthcare for their families and education for their children.  

I am personally passionate about improving lives in our rural communities. 

Our neighbors should not be told to move to larger cities to receive the care and schooling they deserve. Rather, we should build stronger infrastructure and encourage coordination between larger municipalities and smaller, rural towns in order to have thriving communities where all West Texans can prosper.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What qualities do you possess that you believe would make you a successful officeholder?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I care about all members of my community. I am running for office to serve all West Texans, not only the ones who donate to my campaign or even vote for me, but every person living in my district.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What do you believe are the core responsibilities for someone elected to this office?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Above all, public servants need to serve all members of their community, not a select few.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Do you believe that it's beneficial for representatives to have previous experience in government or politics?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I believe it is important that representatives understand sacrifice and leadership. My opponent has never been in a situation where he has had to forgo his own paycheck in order to take care of his employees who rely on him. I know what it means to put others before myself and to recognize my areas of privilege. While serving in Congress, I will put the interests of the voters before the interests of my party and donors. </p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">Who are you? Tell us about yourself in 300 words or less.</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Love is the first word to begin this campaign and is representative of how I will lead in congress, with love. My understanding of justice as a function of love is inspired by the work of Dr. Martin Luther King and I believe this interpretation of justice is what we need, as a nation, at this time. I also believe that first establishing this foundation of love and justice, before addressing the ""issues"", is unique in a political campaign and warrants deep consideration by the people of the 11th district in Ohio and throughout the country. 

My personal and professional experience has prepared me to represent Ohioans in the 11th district with unprecedented care, concern and expertise. My background is in accounting, finance, taxation and public housing. As congressman, I will work toward better outcomes in education and environmental policy, but most of all I will pursue outcomes in equity: equal pay, equal access, and addressing the many and disproportionate challenges that result from poverty and bias. These challenges include, infant and maternal mortality, access to nutrition, and justice reform.

Join me!

 Wrap your arms and mind around this campaign and bring New Spirit to Congress!

Thank you and God bless.

				<p class=""survey-question"">What is the first historical event that happened in your lifetime that you remember? How old were you at the time?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">I can remember the eerie morning of September 11, 2001 like it was yesterday. I was a student at Temple University in Philadelphia, heading to my part-time job on South Street. Now, if you are familiar with Philadelphia and South Street, you know that it is a busy place. Well, the morning of 9/11, I rode my bicycle into work and the streets were empty, I mean completely. When I arrived at my job, it was closed- I was still not aware of what was happening. I then rode to my best friend's nearby apartment. The front door was wide open and he and a few others were sitting on the couch transfixed by what was happening on TV. I was soon informed and soon witnessed the second plane crash into the World Trade Center. This horrific event impacted all of us deeply. Given our proximity and fondness for New York City, we visited Ground Zero (or as close as possible) several times that year. What was the most significant and most inspiring outcome from the event, for me, was how the people of New York came together, how the stereotypical \""New York state of mind\"" was no more. New York immediately became one of the friendliest cities I had known; not just friendly, but heartfelt. From all the pain and tragedy, the world witnessed the resilience and love that filled the eyes and hearts of New Yorkers and Americans throughout the country. This will forever be inspiring to me; I will never forget this.</p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">What was the last song that got stuck in your head?</p>

				<p class=""survey-question"">Do you believe that two years is the right term length for representatives?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">Yes.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">What are your thoughts on term limits?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">There should be term limits to maintain the vitality of Congress. Often we see how career politicians' values lag behind the actual social/cultural progress taking place within the country. Term limits will encourage a more ebullient and innovative Congressional body that is more responsive to social and cultural change.</p>
			</div>
					<div class=""survey-result"">
				<p class=""survey-question"">Both sitting representatives and candidates for office hear many personal stories from the residents of their district. Is there a story that you’ve heard that you found particularly touching, memorable, or impactful?</p>
				<p class=""survey-response"">The genuine love and concern of many residents of Outhwaite Homes in Cleveland whom I have had the pleasure of meeting continues to motivate my campaign. </p>
